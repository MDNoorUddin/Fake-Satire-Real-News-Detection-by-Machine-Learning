Fair-Weather Bills Fan Not Even Banned From Stadium,"BUFFALO—Bragging about his own hardcore dedication to being removed from sports facilities, local fan Rob Henderson reportedly questioned Sunday how his acquaintance Derek Shaw could possibly call himself a fan of the Buffalo Bills if he had never been banned from entering New Era Field. “Listen, I’ve been banned from this place since it was called Rich Stadium, and this guy comes in saying he’s had a ‘seat’ inside there for every game the past two years? Who does he think he is?” said Shaw, ranting that he was tired of dealing with bandwagon fans who had never even gotten ejected for fighting by the concession stands, throwing up on their neighbor, or shouting racist epithets at players. “If you can make it through 10 straight Bills games and not get permanently barred from entering the field and parking lot, I just don’t think you really love this team. It’s in my blood. My father lost his season tickets, my grandpa lost his season tickets, and one day, God willing, I’ll get to see my son get chased down by security, blind drunk and half-nude. Can he say the same? Poser.” At press time, Shaw was showing off his Bills fan bona fides by watching the game on his phone in the backseat of his car after getting kicked out of a local sports bar."
Nationals Admit World Series Win Would Be Way Sweeter If Franchise Was Still In Montréal,"WASHINGTON—Describing the French Canadian municipality as a “world-class city,” Nationals players admitted Thursday that their World Series win would be way sweeter if the franchise stilled played in Montréal. “We’ve never really considered D.C. our home, and we all grew up bleeding Expos blue,” said World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg, speaking in French while lovingly referencing Montréal’s architecture, cosmopolitan culture, and its “incredible cuisine.” “The first thing we did when we got back to the locker room was sing Québec’s anthem. Man, could you imagine driving our parade floats down Catherine Street? It’s great to finally get a ring, but it’ll be a little bittersweet to celebrate with a bunch of D.C. bureaucrats who are just looking for something to do.” At press time, Strasburg admitted to taking some solace in winning a World Series without Bryce Harper."
"Dak Prescott Gains 80 Pounds, Moves Back In With Parents To Prepare For Role In Chunky Soup Ad","DALLAS—Emphasizing his desire to take the appearance seriously, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott reportedly prepared for a role in an upcoming commercial for Campbell’s Chunky Soup by gaining 80 pounds and moving back in with his parents. “It was important to me to be able to come across as a real Chunky Soup consumer,” said the filthy, unshaved Prescott, adding that he wanted to do everything he could to get into the mind of a person who would sit in a half-lit kitchen in the middle of the night as their father made them lukewarm soup out of a can. “I’ve been sleeping less and not drinking water, and I’m waiting to hear back about an application I put in for a part-time job at Best Buy. I just like to give 100% in any job I do. This ad is a great opportunity, and I don’t want to mess it up and look phony by being in shape or happy.” At press time, Prescott had completed his character study by starting a long-distance relationship with a woman he met on an anime subreddit."
Pelicans HR Informs Zion Williamson Knee Surgery Not Covered By Insurance Until 90 Days Into First Season,"NEW ORLEANS—Delivering the news that he will owe the hospital $15,000 for his torn meniscus, Pelicans HR informed Zion Williamson Wednesday that knee surgery is not covered by insurance until 90 days into his first season. “We know it’s frustrating and probably not what he wants to hear right now, but we’ve got to protect ourselves from anyone trying to join the NBA just for health coverage and then immediately quitting,” said compensation and benefits manager Rob Pluthe, noting that Williamson should have been more careful on the court during the six-month transitional period where he would have no medical coverage. “This is just standard practice; we have to keep costs down, so we can’t go paying for surgeries after someone has been a Pelican for less than a year. He’ll also be docked pay for all the time he’s missing with physical therapy.” Pluthe added that Williamson should be careful even after his insurance kicks in, as their provider does not consider knees to be essential body parts."
"NFL Game Day Prepper Stockpiles Coolers Of Bud Light, Hundreds Of Pounds Of Grilled Meat In Underground Bunker","CHICAGO—Wearing a Tom Waddle jersey and armed with a pair of tongs, local NFL game day prepper Hank Pritchard reportedly stockpiled coolers of Bud Light and hundreds of pounds of grilled meats Friday in his underground bunker. “People call me paranoid and crazy for keeping a safe room stocked with burgers, beer, and all the fixins, but it’s imperative to be prepared for any kind of game day emergency,” said Pritchard, 60, showing off the underground bunker outfitted with six George Foreman grills, a chest freezer, 10 crock-pots, a 70-inch 4K TV, two smaller TVs for viewing games concurrently, a La-Z-Boy recliner, a meat smoker, and dozens of framed photographs of Soldier Field. “You never know what could happen when the game starts. People throw an extra pack of brats on the grill and think everything will be okay, but what if the Bears-Saints game goes into overtime? I have at least 500 hot dogs, 200 pounds of Velveeta, 40 bags of chips, and dozens of 30 bricks of light beer on hand at all times. People laugh, but we’ll see who’s laughing when the Super Bowl rolls around and my bunker is the only place around with five-alarm chili.” At press time, an increasingly isolated and aggressive Pritchard confirmed plans to barricade himself in the bunker until the Bears are done for the season."
Scientists Pretending To Be Interested In Kicker Offering Up Brain For Research,"BOSTON—Grinning widely as they thanked him for all the breakthroughs this would surely lead to, researchers from Boston University’s CTE Center politely pretended Wednesday that they were interested in football kicker Justin Tucker’s offer to donate his brain for research. “Oh, yeah! That’s so generous of you, that will definitely help us, for sure,” said the research team, nodding and glancing at each other as the Baltimore Ravens’ kicker expressed how important it was to him to be able to contribute to their work through this gesture. “We’ve never done a kicker brain before! There’s lots to learn, so it’s going to definitely go a long way. We’ll keep in touch with you about this, yeah. 100%.” At press time, the researchers were telling Tucker he could really do some good by putting them in touch with former Raven Ray Lewis."
NBA Quietly Waiting For NFL To Fuck Up And Take Some Heat Off,"NEW YORK—Hoping that it was just a matter of time for some sort of scandal to draw attention away from the recent controversy with China, sources reported Tuesday that NBA commissioner Adam Silver is waiting quietly for the NFL to fuck up and take some heat off. “I’m sure they have some domestic abuse allegations out there to bungle and then we are in the clear,” said Silver, noting that the NFL officiating controversy seemed to have legs but still didn’t make a dent in the NBA’s recent negative coverage. “Maybe I can push someone to leak another damning study on concussions, because I don’t know how much more scrutiny we can take. Something like the Ray Lewis or Aaron Hernandez murders would be great. At the very least, someone could ask anybody in the NFL what they think about China. I’m sure they would forget about us in a second.” Silver added that as long as they kept their heads down and remained optimistic, next week might finally be the moment when a player dies on the field during a live NFL broadcast."
Patriots Bring Up Young Rookie From Practice Squad To Provide Fresh Blood For Tom Brady,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Complimenting the first-year player for providing a valuable contribution to the quarterback’s needs, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick confirmed Wednesday that the team had brought up young rookie Travis Wofford from its practice squad to provide fresh blood for Tom Brady. “He’s been a bit tired these last few weeks, and we think Travis is going to provide just the healthy, nutrient-rich blood Tom requires,” said Belichick, adding that the Patriots first instituted the process in response to Brady’s slow start to the 2012 season, and now transfuse the blood of seven to 10 rookies per year to ensure the 42-year-old quarterback’s circulatory system is constantly flush with the young blood it needs to perform at a high level. “We’re excited for a guy like Travis to come up to the 53-man roster and take reps for a few days in between bloodletting sessions until his body is slowly drained of all liquid. Of course, we only want the highest-quality rookies who follow a strict diet and training regimen so that their blood is the healthiest. That means no junk food, no nightshades, and no taking days off. As long as we keep up the supply of rookies, Tom could easily play into his fifties.” Belichick added that the Patriots were already scouting a college wide receiver who could provide a nice pair of kidneys for Brady during the 2020 season."
Skip Bayless Slams History Of Chinese Post-Opium War Intervention Anxiety In 6-Hour ‘Undisputed’,"LOS ANGELES—Emphasizing that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence were completely useless in a globalized economy, Fox Sports host Skip Bayless spent six hours on Undisputed Wednesday slamming China’s history of intervention anxiety in the post-Opium Wars era. “This is some 19th-century, rookie nationalism right here. China needs to grow up and deal with blowback from the international community if they want to play with the big boys,” said Bayless as he entered his third hour of citing historical facts to support his argument that you could draw a straight line from the punitive measures of the 1858 Treaty of Tientsin to the rise of communism, citing the Cultural Revolution and even the one-child policy as examples of how the nation’s isolationist tendencies impacted modern policy. “I know the forced opening of Chinese ports tore apart the economy for decades and led to the degradation of Qing sovereignty, but they have to get over themselves and realize that in today’s international market you can’t be afraid that any small amount of influence will corrupt the entire system. This all starts with management; if the Communist Party doesn’t set the tone and show some leadership, they are never going to stay contenders.” At press time, co-host Shannon Sharpe made a quick point about how the explicit aggression of the Sino-Indian War undermined the overall theory of territorial unity, leading a furious Bayless to throw down his mic and storm off the set."
Job-Hunting Jay Gruden Frantically Scrubs Social Media Of Anything Associated With Redskins,"ANNAPOLIS, MD—Worried that the humiliating posts would destroy his future employment opportunities, a frantic, job-hunting Jay Gruden scrubbed his social media this week of anything associated with the Redskins. “If anyone sees these photos of me in a Redskins hat, my career is over,” said the former head coach, scrolling through posts and untagging any shots of himself with Redskins owner Dan Synder. “It’s going to suck having a five-year gap in my resume, but I’m pretty sure I can keep it vague and just say I coached with a professional sports team. Maybe I should lean on my time as GM for the Florida Tuskers? What’s rough is that the first thing that pops up on Google after searching my name is ‘Redskins,’ so eventually, I am going to have to figure out some way to explain that.” At press time, Gruden was trying to explain to a prospective employer who inquired about the Redskins that 2014 was just a different time."
Chinese Officials Respond To NBA Controversy By Moving Millions Of Citizens To NHL Re-Fanification Camps,"BEIJING—On the heels of recent pro-Hong Kong comments by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey, Chinese officials responded to the criticism Tuesday by moving millions of Chinese citizens to NHL re-fanification camps. “To show that China will not tolerate this flagrant disrespect for our nation amongst the ranks of the NBA, we intend to enlighten our citizens in the ways of the National Hockey League,” said Vice Premier Han Zheng, overseeing the first of many re-fanification ceremonies in a detention center outside of Beijing where citizens were encouraged at gunpoint to throw NBA merchandise into bonfires and subsequently issued compulsory Sidney Crosby jerseys, posters of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Blu-ray copies of The Cutting Edge. “With this action, we will undo the harmful legacy of basketball on our nation’s psyche, using unyielding exposure to the ways in which hockey aligns with the values of China, a dynasty not unlike that of the Boston Bruins. By the time our citizens board their trains back home, they will not remember that such a thing as the NBA ever existed. All they will know is the joy of a slapshot, the grace of a goalie, and the unlimited potential of the St. Louis Blues in the postseason.” At press time, sources confirmed that officials were forcing unpaid re-fanification camp labor to construct hockey arenas nationwide. "
Vontaze Burfict Expresses Deep Regret For Letting Jack Doyle Live,"OAKLAND, CA—Admitting he was heartbroken over his mistake against the Colts, Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict expressed deep regret Friday that he let Indianapolis tight end Jack Doyle live. “This goes against who I am as a player and the very spirit of the game. I’m sorry Jack was able to leave the field in anything other than a body bag,” said Burfict, adding that the remorse for not fully squaring up on Doyle and delivering a lethal blow to his head was becoming too much to bear. “I’ve been looking back at it all week and I grimace every time I see it. If I had done my job right, he would’ve been laid out on the ground struggling for life instead of remaining conscious and breathing during the whole thing. I am incredibly sorry I pulled up and admit I am taking this lapse in judgment very seriously. This is not what I was hired to do.” Burfict also conceded that the NFL had done their job in suspending him, and that he would have handed down the same punishment to any other player who had failed to deliver a life-ending blow to one of their opponents."
New NCAA Rule Forces Athletes To Remove All Facial Features To Prevent Them From Profiting Off Likeness,"INDIANAPOLIS—Calling it a necessary step in lieu of state legislation challenging student athletes’ unpaid status, the NCAA announced a new rule Thursday forcing athletes to remove all facial features to prevent them from profiting off their likenesses. “We take the amateur nature of our student athletes very seriously, which is why, to thwart any chance that they may profit or receive monetary compensation for their appearance in any way, we’re requiring complete reconstructive facial surgery to remove any and all defining features,” said NCAA spokesman Thomas Collins, noting that their new faceless, indistinguishable bodies will make it impossible for athletes to claim their image is being exploited or monetized. “This is a simple, logical step to protect the integrity of the NCAA. If the game is broadcast on TV, collegiate players should not be able to profit off their position. Additionally, we are going to be removing players’ names and instead referring to them as their team and numbers, so it’ll be Ducks 77 or Crimson Tide’s 13, which will remain their designation for all future correspondence and announcing during games.” At press time, Collins noted that to prevent any future monetization of their position, all student athletes would be euthanized upon graduating or leaving their school."
Bill Belichick Praises Patriots’ Discipline And Dedication In Building The Device,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Lauding the team for making necessary sacrifices for the greater cause, New England head coach Bill Belichick praised the 2019 Patriots Tuesday for their discipline and dedication in building the device. “This a driven team—they’re working day in and day out, putting it all together, always aware that they are working towards a glorious goal,” said the 67-year-old signal caller, commending rookie linebacker Chase Winovich for the hours he’s spent in the film room, studying the device’s origins and inner workings. “This organization is dedicated to greatness, and they know the device will get us there. We’re closer than we’ve ever been to completing it, and I appreciate that they’re not taking the task lightly. It’s always tough when players lose a few limbs, but that’s all part of the process.” At press time, Julian Edelman was listed as questionable for Sunday’s game after team doctors diagnosed the wide receiver with “The Madness.”"
"Cubs Pitching Coach Forced To Clean Up Trembling, Piss-Covered Pitchers After Leaving Them Locked In Bullpen All Day","ST. LOUIS—Spraying down the traumatized players who were standing in puddles of their own excrement, Chicago Cubs pitching coach Tommy Hottovy was forced to clean up a group of trembling, piss-covered pitchers Friday after leaving them locked inside the bullpen all day. “God, I feel so bad that they were trapped in there without anyone to open the gate and let ’em run around,” said Hottovy, lamenting that the pitchers had scratched up the walls and chewed through all of the catcher’s mitts. “I totally spaced after the game yesterday and left them cooped up without any water or anything. I can tell by the look in their eyes that they don’t trust me anymore. Once I opened the gate, a few them just sprinted out and took a huge shit in right field.” At press time, Hottovy was attempting to console a whimpering Craig Kimbrel who had spent the entire game curled up in the corner of the bullpen."
NFL Reaffirms Commitment To Player Safety By Eliminating QB Position,"NEW YORK—In an effort to prevent unnecessary injuries to some of the game’s biggest stars, representatives for the NFL reaffirmed its commitment to player safety Wednesday by eliminating the quarterback position from starting lineups. “We expect some blowback from fans who say you can’t have football without a quarterback, but this safety measure is ultimately what’s best for the player’s health, and quarterbacks are far too valuable to risk letting them get hit on the field,” said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, clarifying that quarterbacks would remain on each team’s roster and retain their multimillion-dollar salaries, but would simply be banned from stepping foot on the field at any time. “All of the research suggests that the quarterback position puts athletes at serious risk, and they should not be subjected to physical contact at any time. Quarterbacks will still be the face of the team, cheering from the sidelines and consulting with coaches on play calls, but moving forward, each play will now begin with a center simply snapping the ball into an empty backfield, triggering a frantic scramble and dogpile for possession of the football.” At press time, the NFL announced a new 15-yard penalty for any team that bumps into the opposing quarterback on the sideline."
Obsessive-Compulsive Baseball Player Has To Touch All 3 Bases Before Going Home,"CINCINNATI—Expressing concern over their teammate’s unhealthy fixation on repeating the process, Cincinnati Reds players confirmed Monday that outfielder Phil Ervin always has to touch all three bases before going to home plate. “He just can’t go near home plate without first touching every single base in order with his foot—it’s a total fixation,” said first baseman Joey Votto, recalling a play where Ervin couldn’t even sprint to home for a score without first going back to “tag up third base.” “I suppose there’s nothing wrong with it, but it gets a little awkward when the entire dugout has to wait for him to round the bases before we can congratulate him on his homer.” At press time, several teammates approached Ervin on his compulsory habit of wearing the same hat and gloves every game."
 Overwhelmed Dolphins GM Asks Players To Please Use Automated Email Form When Making Trade Requests,"MIAMI—Reminding players that the procedure was the fastest, most efficient way for them to all get what they want, General Manager Chris Grier took a moment Friday to remind the Miami Dolphins once again that any incoming trade requests needed to be submitted to him via the automated email form. “I don’t know how many times I have to tell you guys, we have the Google form for a reason, there is no way I can keep track of all these requests otherwise,” said Grier, reiterating that requests submitted through the form would be prioritized over dozens of emails he had received simply reading “Get me out of here,” and that in order to keep requests straight, he at least needed basic information from them such as position, contact info, and name. “We have a little bit of a submission backlog, so unfortunately, some of you might have to keep on playing with us for another month or so. Some people didn’t procrastinate until Week 2 and they deserve first priority. And guys, please don’t just tweet, “I want to be with a contender,” at a bunch of reporters hoping I’ll see it. Also, I need the specific cities you want me to look at when I’m processing your request.” At last report, Grier had been forced to send a follow-up email with a new trade request form after the first one crashed from overuse."
NFL Pre-emptively Adds Whatever Bullshit Gronk Hawking To Banned Substance List,"NEW YORK—Claiming the measure was a necessary precaution to prevent what must be some pretty terrible side effects, representatives for the National Football League announced plans Friday to add whatever bullshit Rob Gronkowski was hawking on social media to the banned substances list. “We’re looking out for the best interests of our players by just going ahead and prohibiting whatever CBD-based nonsense Gronkowski is peddling,” said spokesperson Brian McCarthy, clarifying that league officials had not conducted any formal testing before forbidding the substance, but were 100% confident in the dangers it poses to anyone who ingests it. “After reviewing Gronk’s claims about his ability to heal himself over the course of a summer, we had more than enough information to constitute an immediate, permanent ban. Even if it doesn’t affect or enhance players’ performance, we don’t want to take any chances. As far as we’re concerned, anything that Gronk promotes on Twitter can’t be safe for human consumption.” At press time, league sources announced that they were keeping their eyes on all that Tom Brady “TB12” shit just to be safe."
Cubs Team Doctor Recommends Anthony Rizzo Rehab Injured Ankle By Engaging In Light Physical Activities Like Baseball,"CHICAGO—Encouraging the first baseman to tread carefully during his long recovery process, the Cubs team doctor recommended Thursday that Anthony Rizzo rehab his injured ankle by engaging in light physical activities like baseball. “I told him to take it easy and maybe just try something like nine innings of professional baseball,” said team physician Stephen Adams, explaining that it is far too early for Rizzo to take a risk by playing football, basketball, or tennis, but that a few low-impact turns at the plate would be okay. “Running around the bases should be totally fine, and is actually a great way to rebuild strength. The light jogging and standing baseball calls for is ideal for any athlete looking to bounce back following a sprain of this nature. Hopefully, after a 162-game season of baseball, he should be ready to start playing sports again.” At press time, the Pittsburgh Pirates had announced Ben Roethlisberger would be taking over the starting 3rd baseman role while rehabbing his injured elbow."
Dolphins Fan Starting To Think Brian Flores Not Chief Architect Of Patriots’ Success,"MIAMI—After giving up 43 points in a shut-out game this past weekend, local Dolphins fan Derrick Gomez confirmed Wednesday that he was beginning to think that Miami head coach Brian Flores was not the main driving force behind the New England Patriots’ years of success. “It seemed like a big win for us, at first, getting the guy we assumed was responsible for all those titles, but I’m starting to wonder if he’s not the once-in-a-generation coaching genius I thought he was,” said Gomez, who had assumed that hiring Flores would be the start of a 15-year Dolphins dynasty. “You get someone with that pedigree of being a linebackers coach for a championship team and you think you’ve got a sure thing. I was so excited to think it was all happening, that we got the big dog, Brian Flores, but now I don’t know. I’m just starting to question whether he had anything to do with Tom Brady’s on-field dominance at all.” At press time, Gomez had cursed himself for not realizing that the Lions had lucked out by landing the real architect behind New England’s success in Matt Patricia."
Nike Recalls Sweat-Wicking Shirts That Pulled Gallons Of Liquid Directly From Wearers’ Bodies,"BEAVERTON, OR—Warning customers to return the garments should they find themselves being drained of all fluids, Nike recalled thousands of sweat-wicking shirts Tuesday that inadvertently pulled gallons of liquid directly from wearers’ bodies. “If you or anyone you know puts on a Legend Dri-FIT short-sleeve training shirt and then immediately shrivels into a dried, wrinkled husk, please contact Nike for a full refund,” said spokeswoman Jessica Garland, who apologized directly to customers who purchased a moisture-wicking shirt, only to have every ounce of sweat, urine, and blood sucked out of their body. “You may think it’s okay to wear these shirts for a routine workout at the gym, but be warned—after five minutes of use, you could lose up to 40 pounds of water weight. Even if you wear it to sleep, you could wake up as nothing but a pile of desiccated flesh lying in a puddle.” At press time, Nike was forced to issue a second apology after news broke of a million-dollar lawsuit alleging their compression tops had crushed the torsos of athletes into an infinitesimally small speck of dust."
New ESPN Peyton Manning Segment Breaks Down Current Crop Of Quarterback Commercials,"BRISTOL, CT—Utilizing his expertise as one of the ad game’s all-time great pitchmen, ESPN debuted a new Monday Night Football segment this week featuring Peyton Manning breaking down the current crop of quarterback commercials. “Baker’s delivery is still a little stiff, but he has all the raw tools to deliver championship-level auto insurance for the people of Cleveland,” said Manning of the second-year Browns quarterback, claiming that if Mayfield worked on his follow-through with an acting coach he was well on his way to surpassing Cam Newton’s Under Armour spots. “You can tell Eli is basically done in New York, he looks terrible in this Visa commercial, just no feel or awareness of his surroundings. If we replay the tape here, you can see Saqoun [Barkley] rolling his eyes as he realizes that he’s wasting his prime starring in ads with Eli.” Manning ended the segment by analyzing footage of an Aaron Rodgers commercial, referring to him as a “diminished star” who desperately needs better frame blocking."
"Stephen A. Smith Retreats To Tranquil, Secluded Fig Tree To Contemplate On Meaning Of NFL Week One","NEW YORK—Sitting silently cross-legged as the light breeze and rhythmic breathing focused his mind, ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith retreated to a tranquil, secluded fig tree on Tuesday to contemplate the meaning of the NFL’s first week. “The great mysteries of Baker Mayfield’s performance still elude me, I must focus my mind and calm my soul if I am to truly understand,” said Smith, who claimed that the answer to whether the Seahawks were real contenders was already inside of him and just needed patience to be unlocked. “Only through quiet meditation will these truths be revealed to me, and my week two picks will only result from the kind of clarity that comes from deep solitude. The NFL is filled with chaos and suffering, but the unburdened soul will parse out how it is all connected.” At press time, after hours of meditation, Smith’s third eye had opened and delivered to him the perfect rebuttal that would finally shut up that squirrely prick Max Kellerman."
Indianapolis Motor Speedway Forced To Lower Speed Limit To 20 MPH After Elementary School Opens Next To Straightaway,"INDIANAPOLIS—Capping off weeks of protest from local parents and students alike, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was forced to lower its speed limit to 20 mph Tuesday after an elementary school opened next to the straightaway. “If any IndyCar motorists are found speeding near Lincoln Elementary between the hours of 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., or otherwise while children are present, they will be fined and prosecuted to the highest extent of the law,” said Indy 500 spokesperson Tarah Kissel, adding the school, which was built on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s spectator mound, caters to hundreds of 6- to 10-year-olds who must cross the racetrack Monday through Friday to get to class, regardless of the race schedule. “We understand that parents are concerned, especially given the history of reckless 200-mph driving that occurs near the school crosswalks. That is why, if any driver is caught disobeying a crossing guard or passing a school bus in the drop-off lane, fines will be doubled.” At press time, IndyCar drivers were reportedly up in arms after a rogue basketball rolled onto the speedway during the school’s recess and caused a fiery 12-car crash."
Financial Advisor Urges Ezekiel Elliott To Set Aside 20% Of Salary For Paying Off Women To Keep Quiet,"DALLAS—Referring to the practice as a sound investment that too few players make, Ezekiel Elliott’s financial advisor urged the running back Friday to set aside 20% of his annual salary for paying off women to keep quiet. “We’re thrilled about Zeke’s contract extension, but that money isn’t going to last forever. He needs to be responsible and prepare for the inevitable expenses of trying to silence his accusers,” said wealth advisor Chez Heller, cautioning the Cowboys star that while his playing career might last another decade, he’ll almost certainly be paying to sweep things under the rug for the rest of his life. “We advise all the athletes we work with to set aside 20% for retirement and 20% for any accusers coming out of the woodwork. Elliott is in the prime of his career right now, but he still has to prepare for the eventuality that someone will come forward and reveal what he did to them to the press. Fans see the $50 million payday and think it should last forever without considering all the millions it takes to keep some people from pressing charges.” Heller also advised Elliott to set aside several million in a separate bank account to cover for all the money he would lose to embezzlement."
Gregg Popovich Invites Tim Duncan To Address Team USA On Dangers Of Hypernationalism,"SHANGHAI, CHINA—In an effort to prevent players from falling into a tribalistic mindset, head coach Gregg Popovich invited Tim Duncan Wednesday to address Team USA on the dangers of hypernationalism. “We’ve been hitting the fundamentals of colonialism pretty hard in practice, but I think Tim brings a unique player’s perspective on how phony rivalries between nations can be used to pit working people against each other,” said Popovich, explaining that Duncan’s previous experience playing for Team USA was a perfect example of striving for excellence without dividing people or diminishing outside voices. “This is a young team, so I think they’ll benefit from having a veteran like Duncan showing them how single-minded identification with your country can have dangerous consequences both at home and abroad. We have to respect all cultures, whether they’re playing zone or man-to-man defense. We’re here to prepare for the Olympics next year, not to spread imperialist propaganda.” At press time, a visibly frustrated Popovich forced the team to watch the documentary Ataturk after they narrowly avoided an overtime loss to Turkey."
Case Keenum Wins Redskins Starting Job With Heartfelt ‘What I Like Most About Football Is’ Essay,"WASHINGTON—Impressing coaches and teammates alike with his passion for the game and proper spelling, quarterback Case Keenum won the Redskins starting job Wednesday with a heartfelt essay entitled “What I Like Most About Football Is.” “We went through a bunch of submissions, but Case’s heartfelt five-paragraph essay really stood out for its excellent structure and impressive story about how much fun he has playing with his dad,” said head coach Jay Gruden, touting the section of the piece in which Keenum discussed how football helped him grow up, be more responsible, and learn how to be a hard worker. “It was very nice to see how much passion he has for playing football. The essay was quite persuasive and included good, specific descriptions of both the football field and why he would be good at playing on it. I feel a young man like Case has a very bright future with the Redskins organization.” At press time, Gruden announced that Adrian Peterson had won the starting job in the backfield after collecting the most canned goods from the neighborhood."
"Kid Only Pitcher Because He’s Son Of Coach, Gets Daily One-On-One Training, Goes To Pitching Camp Every Summer","SOUDERTON, PA—Expressing frustration that he has not actually earned his position, Little League sources told reporters Friday that Rory Peters was only the team’s starting pitcher because he’s the son of Coach P, gets daily one-on-one training, and goes to an intensive pitching camp for six weeks every summer. “It’s total bullshit that Rory starts every game just because his dad forces him to practice two hours a night,” said an anonymous source close to the team, dismissing Peters’ standing on the ball club as the product of nepotism and an unbroken focus that has been imposed on him by his father since the age of five. “It’s discouraging to the rest of us to know that we would be up there if we were the coach’s kid and had all his knowledge and effort poured into us. I mean, Peters has a decent fastball, but he’s really not that special. Why not give a chance to someone who isn’t your kid and isn’t half as good as him?” At press time, teammates were taunting Peters for being a little suck up and staying after practice to work on his mechanics."
Derek Carr Distraught After Reading ‘Hard Knocks’ Script Where He Stabs Antonio Brown In Season Finale,"NAPA, CA—Revealing that the writing staff kept his character arc a secret up until the final days, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr felt distraught Friday after reading the scene in his Hard Knocks finale script where he stabs Antonio Brown. “I know the showrunners have been setting up AB’s downfall, but it is still hard to know that I’m going to drive a knife right into his heart,” said Carr, tearfully recalling his role as one of Brown’s biggest supporters in the locker room before his inevitable betrayal of the increasingly unhinged wide receiver. “I know they’ve done these twist endings in the past like when Baker [Mayfield] stabbed Hue Jackson in the back last year. And I get that his character has been pretty arrogant, but this is just a harsh fall for someone who had great expectations. Our audience really loves him, too, so I can only imagine how shaken up they’ll be to watch him killed off.” At press time, Hard Knocks execs revealed that they asked Antonio Brown to adopt the nickname “Mr. Big Chest” this offseason to foreshadow his demise."
"Football Program In Jeopardy After High School Allocates $500,000 To ‘Little Women’ Production","LOWELL, MA—In a huge blow to the already neglected varsity team, the Lowell High School football program found its future season in jeopardy this week after administrators allocated $500,000 of school funds to the theater department’s upcoming production of Little Women. “We’re worried about the future of the program. It just seems like the school district never sees the value of investing in the athletic department,” said football parent Meredith McCoy, who confirmed that the team would have to raise money for new balls this year because of the excess spending by the drama department on authentic 19th-century dresses and handcrafted reproductions of furniture from 1868. “I understand that this is a live-theater town. Parents move to this school district just to get their kids in front of a director to potentially get cast as Meg. The JV boys haven’t had new uniforms in 10 years and yet the school spends $250,000 on dance training for Newsies. Football has value—it’s an outlet for so many misunderstood kids, and to see it constantly pushed to the side like this is disheartening.” At press time, the football team was being forced to practice in a coach’s backyard after the field was demolished to make way for a $10-million state-of-the-art amphitheater."
Jay-Z Pledges To Make Sure Colin Kaepernick Gets Contract At NFL Stadium Shop,"NEW YORK—Promising to do everything in his power to help the former starting quarterback, hip-hop superstar and business mogul Jay-Z pledged Monday to make sure Colin Kaepernick gets a contract with an NFL stadium shop. “Kaepernick has stayed in great shape, and I am confident that he could achieve a great deal of success with an NFL stadium shop,” said Jay-Z, adding that Kaepernick was still in his prime and had the versatility and physical skills to lead a team of retail workers. “This is a guy who can do it all. He can quickly unload deliveries, stock shelves, or run the cash register. I’m certain Colin can sling merchandise like an All-Pro. He could definitely come in and immediately help an NFL team’s retail sales.” Jay-Z later expressed gratitude to be in a position that allowed him to ensure Kaepernick received the justice he so clearly deserved."
Aging Boxing Veteran Wishes Someone Had Told Him Being Punched Unconscious Could Damage His Brain,"BOSTON—Frustrated that he had gone decades in the ring without once being warned of the risks, aging boxing veteran Tony Sheehan told reporters Monday that he wished someone had told him that being repeatedly punched unconscious for years could damage his brain. “I mean, I guess I kind of knew it couldn’t be exactly good for me, but it would have been nice if someone had just sat me down and told me receiving thousands of blows to the head from 200-pound men might give me some issues,” said the 46-year-old former heavyweight, expressing shock and disappointment that none of his former coaches or fellow boxers had talked about how his cognitive function might be negatively impacted by enduring a series of short term, boxing-related comas. “I know there’s always a certain amount of risk involved when competing in a contact sport like this, but this whole brain damage thing really came out of the blue. I would have never made such a shortsighted decision if I knew that 22 years straight of traumatic brain injuries would hurt my brain.” At press time Sheehan had announced his return from retirement."
Cautious Browns Fan Not Expecting Team To Do Better Than 13-3,"CLEVELAND—Taking a “wait-and-see” approach before becoming too emotionally invested in this year’s team, cautious Browns fan Murray Fields told reporters Friday that he wasn’t expecting the franchise to finish better than 13-3 this regular season. “I know some of my friends expect the Browns to have a great year, but we have been burned so many times in the past that I can’t set my expectations any higher than home-field advantage throughout the playoffs,” said Fields, 35, revealing he will consider the season a success even if the team loses the AFC Championship Game. “Is this roster exciting? Yeah. Could Baker Mayfield throw for 5,000 yards? Sure. But I’m trying to stay grounded. I don’t want to be heartbroken at the end of the year when we’ve only won 12 games and swept our division rivals. I know 16-0 is a real possibility, but I would just say I’m cautiously optimistic.” Fields added that even with their current talent he felt like the Browns were still a year or two away from a five Super Bowl dynasty."
"Report: Little League Pitchers Could Avoid Overtaxing Their Arms By, You Know, Getting Somebody Out","ATLANTA—Stressing that it was a simple solution to avoid long-term injuries, researchers from Emory Healthcare published a report Friday suggesting that Little League pitchers could avoid overtaxing their arms by, you know, getting somebody out for a change. “We strongly recommend young pitchers avoid needless strain on their ligaments and tendons by actually throwing some balls over the goddamn plate,” said Director Of Sports Medicine Neeru Jayanthi, asserting pitch counts and extended rest would not be necessary if young players would just do what they were sent out on the mound to do. “We’re truly horrified when we see reports of starters throwing 70-plus pitches, when young players wouldn’t have to throw more than 50 if they could figure how to get that curveball to break away from the hitter and not right into the barrel of his fucking bat. Another surefire way to avoid wear and tear is to stop walking batters. Pitchers are having Tommy John surgery earlier and earlier these days, so we really can’t stress the value of doing this little exercise called ‘striking someone out.’” Jayanthi urged players who were really worried about the threat of injury to just quit because they’re clearly not cut out for the sport."
Report: It Crazy MLB Still Counts Stats From Segregated Era,"PHOENIX—Claiming that even one second of actually thinking about it makes you realize just how nuts the whole thing is, the Society Of American Baseball Research published the results of a study Thursday finding that it’s crazy the MLB still counts statistics from the sport’s segregated era. “After months of data analysis, we’ve concluded that it’s batshit insane that MLB counts stats from an era where many of the best players were completely barred from the league,” said co-author Henry Hamrah, reminding record keepers that the MLB went out of its way to endlessly debate the much more complicated merits of steroid-era players while just acting like the segregated era never happened. “The numbers are just in there like nothing was different. They are out of their goddamn minds. It’s not even that hard of a fix; just create a separate category for pre-segregation players and be done with it. African-American players were banned, and you act like everything is legit? It’s so fucked up you almost have to wonder if they’re even aware they never fixed it?” Hamrah concluded by suggesting the MLB could start making good by removing 90% of pre-segregation players from the Hall-of-Fame."
NFLPA Warns Holdouts They Need To Consider The Risk That They’ll End Up Having To Sign With Jets,"WASHINGTON—Reminding players that failing to report to training camp was a high-risk move with no guarantee of success, the National Football League Players Association released a statement Friday warning holdouts that they might end up having to sign with the New York Jets. “We understand you want a better contract, but you have to weigh that desire against the very real chance you will eventually be forced to sign with the Jets,” said NFLPA president Eric Winston, reminding players to consider those worst-case scenarios when leveraging potential suitors against their current teams. “Obviously, we support our players getting the money they deserve, but before you sit out week 1, just imagine having to see your family in Jets gear. Remember, this is still a negotiation and you shouldn’t overplay your hand. It’s our job to look out for your best interests and to let you know that you’re in danger of spending the prime of your career going 4-12 for an unforgiving fanbase.” At press time, the NFLPA announced a push for more lucrative pensions to compensate players who had their careers and futures irreparably damaged after being forced to play for the Jets."
Perfectionist Jon Gruden Forces ‘Hard Knocks’ To Film 78th Take Of Scene Where He Cuts Rookie,"NAPA, CA—Determined to ensure the editing team “had enough coverage to work with,” perfectionist head coach Jon Gruden forced the ‘Hard Knocks’ production crew Wednesday to film 78 takes of a scene where he cuts a rookie running back. “I really liked how your face looked in that first take when I rattled off your major weaknesses—could you hit those moves with just a little more intensity?” said the Raiders signal-caller, who reviewed raw footage of the scene before instructing the 21-year-old halfback to adjust his chair to the left so Gruden could get a cleaner over-the-shoulder shot. “Actually, could you go back into the hallway and then walk into my office, so I can cut you again? I thought my ad-lib about what it means to be a Raider was pretty good, so I’ll try that again with a stronger inflection this time. Oh, and could you wipe the tears out of your eyes until I tell you to turn in your playbook? It doesn’t work if they come in too early. And now that I think about it, you probably shouldn’t be wearing that Raiders jersey either, wardrobe can get you a T-shirt.” At press time, Gruden had fired the ‘Hard Knocks’ crew and taken over all filming, directing, audio, and editing duties."
Man Told He’d Never Make It As Pro Defies Them All By Sucking For 4 Years In AA Ball,"HARTFORD, CT—Dedicating his next ground out to all the people who tried to keep him down, minor leaguer Adam Brosseau confirmed Monday that he had defied everyone who said he’d never make it as a professional baseball player by sucking for four years in Double-A. “They said I’d never make it back in high school, but now I’m getting paid $1,700 a month to chase my dreams. I can’t wait to see the looks on all their faces when they see me out there with the Hartford Yard Goats,” said Brosseau, 27, who claimed everyone who told him to give up on baseball must feel pretty embarrassed after watching him bounce around to five separate farm teams. “I bet all those haters are sitting at their desk jobs right now, watching me get stranded on second base and thinking ‘Man, we were stupid for doubting Adam.’ They swore I’d never amount to anything, but look who’s getting the last laugh. How many of them could hit 120 pop flies over the course of three seasons?” At press time, Brosseau was confronting his latest doubter by asking the manager at Home Depot not to fire him and promising he would not be late for another shift again."
Kawhi Leonard Worried He’s Succumbing To Glitzy L.A. Lifestyle After Purchasing Flashy 2016 Subaru,"LOS ANGELES—Feeling a lingering sense of guilt over the sudden betrayal of all his values, Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard worried Friday that he had succumbed to the glitzy L.A. lifestyle after purchasing a flashy 2016 Subaru Forester. “I’ve only been in Hollywood a few weeks and I’m already living the high life. Look at this thing—lightly scratched blue paint job, one of those cords to plug in my iPod, and even a responsive set of power windows. What have I become?” said the two-time Finals MVP, who vowed not to let his new surroundings change him only to find himself cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway at 52 miles per hour with two whole cupholders holding fancy Evian water. “This just isn’t me. I can’t believe I let the dealer talk me into buying a car where you can fold both side mirrors. I told myself I wouldn’t let this town change me, but here I am, breathing in one of those vanilla air-fresheners and parking with the help of a backup camera. I can’t forget where I came from just because I’m sitting in faux leather seats.” At press time, Leonard called a childhood friend to ask if he “seems different” after purchasing a condo with central air-conditioning."
Tim Duncan Maps Out Spurs’ Genealogy After Being Hired As Team Archivist,"SAN ANTONIO—Returning to the organization in an official capacity for the first time since his 2016 retirement, former NBA star Tim Duncan was reportedly embarking on a large-scale project Wednesday mapping out the San Antonio Spurs’ genealogy after being hired as the team archivist. “We’re thrilled to have Tim back in the fold, and were happy to honor his request by bringing him on as the Spurs’ head archivist—there’s no one better suited than Tim to chronicle the team’s history, trace players’ lineage, and document important items from our past,” said head coach Gregg Popovich, showing reporters the massive genealogical chart Duncan had created for each of the Spurs’ players mapping not only their personal ancestry and NBA career but also tracking the development of their individual playing style and charting their closest statistical comparisons to previous players going back to college basketball games in the early 1900s. “He’s really jumped right in—he asked if he could set up an office in the AT&T Center catacombs, which we didn’t even know were there, so we let him go right ahead. Of course, he already knew a lot of the team’s Xs and Os from his work cataloguing the evolution of the Spurs offense, and once he finishes digitizing them it’s going to be quite the resource for our staff and younger guys. He’s planning to set up a playbook library and a museum for displaying artifacts from the time when the organization was known as the Dallas Chaparrals—he apparently had a number of them in his private collection already. We think he’ll be a great fit.” Reached for comment, Duncan said he was also putting out a request for players’ diary entries, NBA game logs, and other materials that would help him on his long-term project to publish a history of the Western Conference. "
"LeBron James Reveals School He Founded Has Seen Huge Gains In English, Math, And Dunk Testing","AKRON, OH—Expressing pride that the curriculum he helped put in place was already bearing fruit in critical areas of study, LeBron James revealed Wednesday that students at his I Promise elementary school have seen huge gains in English, math, and dunk testing. “I’m truly humbled to be making a difference in my community, where so many of these kids tested way below the national average in tomahawk jams, and now they’re on pace to rank in the 90th percentile for both chemistry and alley-oops,” said James, who credited the school’s small class sizes for giving the kids the hands-on attention they need to learn how to “really throw it down.” “We’ve seen dramatic improvement across the board, from reading comprehension and arithmetic to jump shooting and Jelly layups. It’s amazing to watch kids who could barely even palm the ball a few years ago slam home windmills like it’s nothing. Of course, these are still young kids, so they have to continue making strides until they’re able to dunk a regulation-sized basketball—which is a graduation requirement.” At press time, James had announced a new scholarship program to help Akron-area high schoolers gain admission to prestigious Ivy League dunking programs."
ESPN Impressed By Mark Sanchez’s Ability To Point Out Football Field,"BRISTOL, CT—Noting that the former USC quarterback’s grasp of the game and its nuances was immediately obvious, ESPN executives were impressed Tuesday by Mark Sanchez’s ability to point out the football field. “The second we brought Mark in, we just knew he was the one. He could watch a play and locate the 50-yard line without hesitation,” said anchor Kevin Negandhi, who sat in with Sanchez as he went over game tape of Clemson and Notre Dame and deftly identified whether the plays were passes or runs. “He’s just a natural talent in the broadcast booth. We didn’t even have to ask, he just started naming things on the football field. He said grass, he said end zone. He even knew exactly what the football was. We’re confident Mark will be just as impressive in the studio as he was on the field.” At press time, Sanchez had finished his first dress rehearsal with 47% anecdote success and mediocre 34.5 broadcaster rating."
Phoenix Suns Gorilla Involved In Altercation At Glendale-Area Gentlemen’s Club,"GLENDALE, AZ—Responding to leaked video footage of the drunk simian shoving a dancer and throwing a bottle of Dom Pérignon at a fellow patron, authorities confirmed Wednesday that the Phoenix Suns Gorilla was involved in a late-night altercation at the Essex Gentlemen’s Club. “He was pretty belligerent all night. At around 1 in the morning, they finally called the police after he knocked a guy out and then pulled a knife on the security guard,” said an anonymous strip club patron, who recalled a tense moment when Gorilla brandished a T-shirt gun and threatened one of the bartenders for watering down his drinks. “I knew something was about to go down when he first called one of the girls ‘a bitch’ for walking away from him. He was there with a couple other mascots, and whenever he gets together with Basket The Bobcat and Big Red, you know they’re gonna get into trouble. They don’t mean much harm, but once they pop a few bottles and start busting out the trampolines, things can get out of hand fast.” At press time, Gorilla deleted all mentions of the Phoenix Suns on his social media amid reports that the team was looking to trade him. "
Norfolk Tides Third Baseman Sent Down To Baltimore Orioles,"BALTIMORE, MD—Hoping to give the still-developing prospect more time to find his game, the Norfolk Tides announced Wednesday that third-baseman Anderson Feliz would be sent down to the Baltimore Orioles. “Feliz has been dealing with a couple of injuries and he’s had a little bit of a slump, so we think this will be a good way to build up his confidence,” said Tides manager Gary Kendall, explaining that Feliz would be spending a season “working on the fundamentals” with the Baltimore squad until he’d worked his way up to the level of play consistent with AAA ball. “I know he’s disappointed right now to be leaving for Baltimore, but in the end, it’ll be for the best. He shouldn’t take this too hard because we consider him a big part of the future of the Tides. Right now, he’s a little over his head, but he’ll fit right in with the Orioles. And after another season, he should be ready to move on to bigger and better things.” Kendall went on to add that he was glad Feliz at least got some time with the Tides, as it might have been too big an ego hit to have him start for the Orioles on opening day."
Giannis Antetokounmpo Credits Success To Early Days Playing Against Greek Gods,"MILWAUKEE, WI—Asserting that the rough-and-tumble style of play he learned on Mount Olympus was the reason he is here today, Giannis Antetokounmpo told reporters Tuesday that he credits his NBA success to his childhood days of playing basketball against Greek gods. “I really honed my skills on the court by squaring off against old-timers like Ares and Athena. I wouldn’t be the player I am now without having to dodge boulders thrown by 20-foot Titans or fend off Cerberus in the paint,” said the 24-year-old Greece native, who attributed his ability to finish through contact to Hephaestus raising mountains in front of him as he went in for dunks. “I’m so grateful that I got to play Zeus one-on-one—I got so much stronger from trying to post him up while he assumed the form of a brick wall. I actually mastered my euro step by dodging his lightning bolts en route to the basket. In fact, most of those gods could get across the entire court in less than two strides, so I didn’t really know it was a big deal until I started playing stateside. Those deities helped make me who I am today.” Antetokounmpo also revealed that he signed an endorsement deal with Nike as a way to pay off the 5,000 silver drachmas he owes every year as a tribute to the Olympians."
Nenê Wins NBA’s Tenth Man Of The Year Award,"HOUSTON—Commemorating the veteran big man for the minutes worth of contributions he made to a great Rockets team, Nenê Hilario was honored as the Tenth Man Of The Year at Monday night’s NBA Awards. “Whether he was high-fiving teammates after a timeout or setting a couple ball screens while the starters rested, Nenê defined an exemplary tenth man,” said head coach Mike D’Antoni, who gave credit to Hilario for Houston having some of the best post-dunk bench celebrations in the league and praised his invaluable part in locker room pranks. “We’re thrilled that Nenê is finally getting recognized for all he does. Stats just don’t capture the value of someone who can check in, give someone a hard foul, and immediately check out of the game. From physically restraining teammates in an altercation to getting in the ref’s face to argue a bad call, he has been instrumental in our team’s success.” At press time, Nenê had been traded away by the Rockets for a late-round 2021 pick in a salary-cap dump to help re-sign James Harden next year."
"James Harden, Chris Paul Deny Rumors Of Discord, Say They Are Fully Committed To Team At State Farm","HOUSTON—Attempting to set the record straight about reports of a toxic work relationship between the two players, James Harden and Chris Paul publicly denied rumors of discord Friday and reiterated that they remain fully committed to the team at State Farm Insurance. “Things may get heated from time to time, but at the end of the day, we both know all we want success for State Farm,” said Harden in a statement to the press, hoping to assure fans that they would be seeing the pair bouncing jokes off each other in State Farm commercials for years to come. “Sure, sometimes we might clash over the artistic direction of a commercial or if someone accidentally steps on someone else’s line, but it’s all done out of love for State Farm. Even though we may lose our heads now and then, we’re still very passionate about our performance in these commercials. We’re both in this for the long haul and want to build a real legacy here.” Harden and Paul both agreed that with a little more investment in new talent, State Farm could end up as the number-one insurance company in the country."
Little League Coach Just Washed-Up Former Little Leaguer,"DERBY, KS—Speculating that the sad former star was probably just attempting to relive his glory days, several sources told reporters Friday that Little League coach Mark Clancy, 27, was nothing but a washed-up former Little Leaguer. “Look at him out there acting like he’s this big deal. This guy hasn’t been in the Little League for years. It’s pathetic,” said spectator Louise Birch on the out-of-shape coach of the Wichita regional Little League team, speculating that Clancy’s MVP medal for the Benton school Wolfpack went straight to his head and he’s never let it go. “You can just tell he thinks he knows it all just because he had a few good seasons back in the Westurban pee-wee league in the mid-’90s. He’s trying to make it feel like it did when he was 8 years old and throwing people out at first or batting .125. Yeah, he was pretty good in his prime—a lot of people around here remember him from back then—but to see him at 27? It’s just sad. He never even won a Little League World Series.” Birch also recalled the game two decades ago, where Clancy completely choked and let the ball roll between his legs, tripping backwards before accidentally throwing the ball to the third base instead of second."
Knicks Front Office Scrambling After Zion Williamson Drafted Before 3rd Pick,"BROOKLYN, NY—Nervously pacing and muttering under their breath after having their draft board completely blown up, the New York Knicks front office was scrambling Thursday after the Pelicans drafted Zion Williamson before they could take him with the third overall pick. “We were so sure that Zion was going to fall to us that we haven’t really scouted or evaluated any of the other players. It’s devastating,” said General Manager Scott Perry, who claimed that nobody in the Knicks front office had heard anything about the Pelicans’ interest in drafting Williamson and that their entire off-season strategy was predicated on adding him to the roster. “Zion was our guy, we were so sure about it, we even have the ‘Williamson’ jersey that we were going to hand to him sitting here in our office. We knew other teams were interested, but all of our expertise and research said he was going to be available. Now we just have to make a wild guess with whoever is left.” Perry added that this was the Knicks’ biggest draft day surprise since they had planned to draft Anthony Davis with the 48th pick in 2012."
Nike Unveils Size-Inclusive Mannequin Eating A 12-Inch Hoagie,"BEAVERTON, OR—In what the sportswear giant is hailing as a company-wide embrace of body positivity, Nike announced Tuesday it would introduce its first-ever size-inclusive mannequin, a hefty male figure eating a 12-inch hoagie. “We want everyone to feel represented when shopping at a Nike store, so now each of our locations across the United States will feature mannequins going to town on a wide variety of classic sandwiches, including roast beef subs, chicken parm heroes, and meatball grinders,” said company spokesperson Alexandria Wilt, adding that each mannequin would wear a mustard-stained Nike shirt matted with pieces of shredded lettuce and provolone, as well as a fitness tracker on its wrist indicating it had walked 17 steps to the fridge to grab a jar of mayonnaise. “Whether you eat sandwiches standing over the kitchen sink or prefer to let your hoagie rest on your torso while reclining on a couch, Nike makes gear for your lifestyle. We want customers to see themselves depicted in media associated with our brand, and we’re proud to celebrate bodies of all shapes and sizes as they hunch over all kinds of great subs.” At press time, Nike confirmed it had added a 32-ounce energy drink to the mannequin’s hand to address concerns the representation would be unrealistic without there being something for it to wash down the hoagie with."
Nike Touts New Sports Bra With Latest Breast-Crushing Technology,"BEAVERTON, OR—Claiming their new extra-supportive workout garment represents a huge step forward for women in athletics, Nike unveiled a new sports bra Tuesday showcasing the absolute latest in breast-crushing technology. “Our new state-of-the-art FlattenX sports bra guarantees that your breasts will be not only supported throughout your workout, but virtually obliterated as this landmark design smashes them into total submission,” a Nike press release read in part, also detailing the newly formulated poly-blend fabric engineered to essentially vacuum-seal the human breast to the ribcage, leaving women unencumbered and streamlining their physique for more efficient exercise. “From jogging and powerlifting to yoga and pilates, the FlattenX guarantees that the existence of your breasts will never again pose a threat to your workout. If you’ve been let down in the past by sports bras that stretch or sag after just a few wear cycles, don’t worry—the panelwork of Nike’s flagship sports bra ensures that any and all breasts remain painfully constricted for hours, forcing wearers to call the fire department to come cut you out of it with the Jaws of Life.” The press release also teased the upcoming release of the Bae Constrictor, a new line of organ-warping women’s leggings; the Footbinder Alpha, a slimming women’s running sock crafted from spun copper and silk; and the Nike BreezeChute, a loose-fitting and breathable new series of men’s shorts."
"Warriors Attribute Finals Loss To Durant’s Ruptured Achilles, Klay’s Torn ACL, Curry Being Hit By Bus Near End Of Game 6","OAKLAND, CA—Reviewing the circumstances that led to their defeat by the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors attributed their series loss to forward Kevin Durant rupturing his Achilles, guard Klay Thompson tearing his ACL, and guard Steph Curry being hit by a bus near the end of game six. “No disrespect to Toronto, because they played a great series, but we can’t help thinking that [Kevon] Looney’s lingering chest injury, Draymond [Green] falling into that woodchipper early in game five, and Shaun [Livingston] getting harpooned and rupturing most of his internal organs played a role in our defeat,” said head coach Steve Kerr, adding that it was hard to keep the momentum going after a combine harvester ran over the entire bench in game five. “We don’t want to use our injuries as an excuse, but we just want to acknowledge that it’s really hard to craft strong lineups when you’re dealing with DeMarcus Cousins limping around after multiple on-court knife wounds, or when you lose a guy like [Andre] Iguadola, who was hobbled from the Oracle’s ceiling collapsing and crushing his legs. Plus, that bus ran over Curry so many times—tough when you lose your best shooter because all his fingers have been ripped off. It’s too bad we didn’t get to see what the Finals would’ve looked like without all our starters contracting hemlock poisoning and Andrew Bogut getting struck by lightning on three separate occasions.” Reporters’ final questions about the Warriors’ future were handled by assistant coach Mike Brown after Kerr fell into an open manhole in the Oracle Arena press room and owner Joe Lacob spontaneously combusted."
Golfer Can Never Remember If He’s Matt Kuchar Or Brooks Koepka,"PEBBLE BEACH, CA—Scouring the leaderboard to find a name that looked familiar, a professional golfer playing at the U.S. Open Friday admitted that he can never remember if he’s Matt Kuchar or Brooks Koekpa. “I know I’ve won the U.S. Open, so there’s a good chance I’m Koekpa, but I know Brooks is a Nike guy, and it looks like I’m wearing Under Armour, so that can’t be right,” said pro-golfer Jordan Spieth, who decided he might have actually been thinking of Matt Kuchar or Martin Kaymer or Adam Scott when he was trying to remember himself. “For a second I was like, ‘Oh, yeah I’m Dustin Johnson,’ but then I remembered he has a beard so that’s not it. I can’t speak Italian, so I’m definitely not [Francisco] Molinari. I swear there are so many of us that I always get tripped up, although I suppose it doesn’t really matter that much.” At press time, Spieth concluded that he was Justin Thomas and headed back over to the fairway to resume playing with Jordan Spieth."
St. Louis Officials Encourage Celebrating Blues Fans To Just Burn City Down And Finally End This,"ST. LOUIS—Saying that the city has had this coming for a long time and this moment was as good a time as any, St. Louis officials encouraged fans celebrating the Blues Stanley Cup victory Wednesday to just burn the city down and finally end everyone’s suffering. “To all the Blues fans out there who may be smashing windows or starting fires, all we can say is: Absolutely do that. We’ve dealt with this place for far too long, and we are ready for it to die,” said Mayor Lyda Krewson, who claimed the city was taking steps to aid any rioters by placing bins full of bricks, lighters, and baseball bats around the St. Louis along with idling bulldozers that any Blues fan could commandeer free of punishment. “Obviously, a lot of fans are going to be drunk, and we think that’s great. As long as you’re damaging property, the police aren’t going to bother you—in fact, they might even be ordered to help. Crash cars into buildings, tear apart bus stops, pull down the fucking Arch for all we care. It’s over. St. Louis isn’t worth it. We don’t give a shit anymore.” At press time, Mayor Krewson was seen greeting celebrating fans on the street before grabbing a trash can and smashing in the window of a liquor store."
NBA Commentators Confirm Steve Kerr Not Enough Of An Insufferable Prick To Be Considered All-Time Great Coach,"OAKLAND, CA—Calling it the ultimate measure of a professional basketball coach’s worth, NBA commentators confirmed Monday that Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was ultimately not enough of an insufferable prick to be really considered an all-time great coach. “Sure, Kerr’s had a few great seasons, but what’s really holding him back from true legendary status is that we can’t valorize his completely dehumanizing behavior toward players,” said analyst Chauncey Billups in an on-air discussion, contending that despite his years of success and admittedly impressive moments of mistreatment, Kerr still had “a long way to go” in terms of achieving a place in the pantheon of truly heartless, psychologically abusive NBA coaches. “It’s really a measure of an all-time great coach to see them belittling and screaming at their players like they’re children. You can’t truly be a leader without constantly flying off the rails in a frothing rage or publicly questioning people’s manhood at press conferences. Until we see that out of Kerr, it doesn’t matter how many rings they win.” Billups added that if Kerr truly wanted to be in the Hall of Fame, he would at least have to get himself fired for feuding with Steph Curry, and then try and make a comeback by coaching three sub-500 seasons with the Knicks."
U.S. Women’s Soccer Team Handing Out Flyers To Advertise World Cup Tournament,"NEW YORK—As they stood on the corners of several busy intersections, members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team reportedly handed out flyers Friday to advertise their participation in the FIFA World Cup tournament, letting passersby know they would really appreciate everyone’s support. “It’s going to be pretty cool. We get to go to France and represent our entire country. We’re even favored to win,” forward Alex Morgan said to a pedestrian who crossed the street to avoid the Olympic gold medalist while her teammates taped several of the handmade flyers to telephone poles and asked local business owners to post them in their shop windows. “We’re playing Thailand on Tuesday, and it’s going to be on TV, so check it out. If you enjoy the match, we hope you’ll consider making a donation to our new-uniform fund. It would really up our game to trade in the men’s team’s hand-me-downs we’ve been wearing and get some shin guards that fit.” At press time, sources confirmed members of the defending Women’s World Cup champions were disheartened after passing several trash cans filled with the leaflets they had just distributed."
Saudi Arabia Feeling Skittish About Doing Business With Autocratic Tyrant Vince McMahon,"JEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA—Expressing trepidation about hosting WWE’s Super ShowDown event in light of countless human rights abuses perpetrated by the wrestling company’s divisive owner, Saudi Arabia was feeling skittish Friday about doing business with autocratic tyrant Vince McMahon. “There’s a lot of money to be made here, but it’s hard not to feel gross dealing with someone like Vince McMahon. We don’t really want to be affiliated with someone who has so ruthlessly hurt hundreds of people,” said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, referring to McMahon as a “megalomaniac” who is completely out of touch with reality and who routinely betrays his most loyal followers. “Business is business, but there’s a lot of questionable behavior associated with the McMahon name, and we don’t want him to sully the name of Saudi Arabia. The whole family has been a human-rights disaster since his father Vince McMahon Sr. came to power. His treatment of women and ethnic minorities over the last four decades has been flat-out dehumanizing, and he never even tries to improve his organizations. He just keeps covering up his actions with lies and denials.” At press time, bin Salman said he was “seriously considering” backing out his deal with McMahon after watching a harrowing documentary about Bret Hart and the Montreal Screwjob."
Dedicated Warriors Fan Contends He Was Obnoxious Asshole Long Before Team Got Good,"OAKLAND, CA—Bragging that he had been committed to this far longer than all the front-runners, longtime Golden State Warriors fan Marcus McBain insisted to reporters Wednesday that he was an obnoxious asshole long before the team got good. “So many people act like hardcore Warriors fans just appeared when they started winning, but I’ve been dedicated to being a huge, annoying douchebag for over 20 years,” contended McBain, glowing with pride as he described the many long, thankless years he spent as a rude, abhorrent jerk before his favorite NBA team eventually found consistent success. “It takes real dedication to be loudly, obnoxiously obsessed with a team that isn’t even doing that well. It was tough back in the 2000s when they were pretty hopeless, but even then, I’d be there at games trying my best to scream at players, argue with the refs, and generally ruin the night of everyone around me. I’m proud to say I’m not some bandwagon asshole; I was always a fucking prick about the Warriors, I just get to enjoy it more now.” McBain went on to vow that he would always remain a die-hard irritating piece of shit no matter what setbacks the team might face in the future."
Andrew McCutchen Embarrassed He Somehow Hurt Himself Playing Baseball,"PHILADELPHIA—Trying desperately to come up with a less emasculating explanation for the injury, Andrew McCutchen admitted Wednesday that he was too embarrassed to tell everyone that he actually got hurt playing baseball. “God, this is humiliating. How do you get hurt just running around a stupid baseball diamond? There is no way I’m going to live this down,” said the Phillies outfielder, confiding that he told his neighbors he fell off a ladder while cleaning his gutters rather than admit the truth that he managed to tear his ACL in a sport with minimal movement and almost no physical contact. “It’s not like I was diving for a catch or collided with a catcher while trying to dive into home. Half these guys have pot-bellies and they don’t get hurt. I was so embarrassed at first I told the doctor I slipped on a spill in the locker room. Even that’s tougher than getting hurt playing fucking baseball.” At press time, McCutchen had retreated to the locker room after being bullied by his fellow teammates for his pathetic injury."
Cleveland Indians Game Delayed As Slider Goes Into Labor On Field,"CLEVELAND—Halting play and rushing team doctors on field after the mascot reported feeling painful contractions, the Cleveland Indians were forced to delay a game Tuesday after Slider began to go into labor on the field. “After we saw this purple viscous puddle on the grass, we realized Slider’s water had broken. We thought there would be time to rush to the hospital, but it soon became clear that Slider’s baby wasn’t going to wait,” said Indians spokesperson Holly Perez, adding that the initial panic followed by stunned silence as the onlooking fans watched the Indians first base coach lay Slider down on the field and provide comfort while doctors rushed out blankets and equipment. “We knew Slider was due to give birth soon, but this little miracle ended up coming almost a week ahead of schedule. Despite the stress, it was beautiful to watch the team come together, with Zach Plesac holding Slider’s hand and Terry [Francona] encouraging Slider to push. We’re so excited to welcome Slider’s new baby, Brandon Michael, to the Cleveland Indians family.” Perez also confirmed that Slider would be absent for the rest of the regular season for maternity leave."
Robert Kraft Agrees To Take Voluntary Leave Of Absence From Orchids Of Asia Day Spa,"JUPITER, FL—Insisting that he didn’t want to place an undue burden on a group of people who have served him so well, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft released a statement Thursday announcing his plans to take a voluntary leave of absence from the Orchids of Asia Day Spa. “It is incredibly difficult to walk away from a place that’s been like a second home to me,” said the 77-year-old, who referred to his self-imposed hiatus from the spa he has poured countless hours and large sums of money into as “one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever made.” “I’m really going to miss it. I love the staff; I know them all by name, and I’m sure they’ll tell you I’m usually the first one to arrive and the last one to leave. I’ve always dreamed of being a part of a place like Orchids of Asia, and I just hope they can survive until my return.” Kraft ended his statement by announcing that his son Joshua would assume his responsibilities at the spa while he’s on leave."
Blues Forced To Forfeit Stanley Cup After Exhausting Annual Travel Budget,"ST. LOUIS—Unexpectedly ceding the championship to the Boston Bruins without getting to play a single game, the St. Louis Blues announced Monday that they have been forced to forfeit the Stanley Cup after exhausting their annual travel budget. “This is our bad. The owners have been tightening their belts and we just completely blew through our travel expense allotment for 2019 with that last series against San Jose,” said Blues head coach Craig Berube, explaining that the team had spent way too much on room service, taxis, and nice meals during several road trips early in the season, which forced management to slash their budget for the remainder of the year. “We did everything we could to cut costs after we realized we were over budget, switching from staying in hotels to Airbnbs and giving everyone peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner, but it just wasn’t enough. We could probably get a few guys up to Boston for game one if they were willing to crash on someone’s couch, but it would be nowhere near enough for a full lineup. So congratulations to the Bruins for planning their expenses so well and taking home the Stanley Cup.” Berube added that because of the cost overrun, the Blues would also be forfeiting the first 20 road games of next season."
"Chicago Authorities Free Over 2,000 Southpaws From Illegal Mascot Mill","CHICAGO—In what authorities are calling the largest underground anthropomorphic-monster-breeding bust in several decades, the Chicago Police Department freed over 2,000 Southpaws Friday from an illegal White Sox mascot mill on the city’s southwest side. “We received repeated complaints from locals who mentioned excessive noise and a strong, unpleasant odor coming from this old warehouse, so we went down into the basement and found all these poor Southpaws in a small dark room. Makes your stomach turn,” said Officer Travis Gomez, who shared departmental video of the investigative team kicking down the warehouse door to reveal thousands of furry, green plush monsters, some of them less than a full season in age, all tightly confined to a cramped, low-ceilinged room without adequate lighting or ventilation. “It was really hard to see. Some of the pups tipped the scales at only 30 or 40 baseballs, a far cry from the 621 a healthy Southpaw should weigh. The adults were obviously far too malnourished to climb on top of a dugout and dance, let alone engage in a three-legged race with kids from a game-day crowd, and the females were almost broken from being kept pregnant for years on end. We’re hoping they can find a home with different minor league franchises out there, but Southpaws are pretty aggressive, so it’ll take some adjustment. Many will probably wind up with ECHL hockey teams.” Gomez urged those looking to adopt any mascot to make sure they obtain them from a reputable breeder."
Depressed LeBron James Realizes That At His Age Copernicus Was Developing Theory Of Heliocentrism,"LOS ANGELES—Experiencing an existential crisis after comparing accomplishments, a depressed LeBron James, 34, realized Monday that at his age Nicolaus Copernicus was already developing his groundbreaking theory of heliocentrism. “Jesus, all my life up to this point has just been playing basketball, when in his early 30s, Copernicus was already starting to lay the foundation that the sun, not the Earth, was the center of our solar system,” said James, explaining that winning three championships and becoming a four-time league MVP was fine and all, but his achievements paled in comparison to Copernicus upending the Ptolemaic model of geocentrism that had prevailed for over 1,500 years. “Sure, that was a different era, but I can’t help but feel like a failure when I think about how I’ve never redefined how we think of the universe and our place in it. Not to mention the Lakers didn’t even make the playoffs. God, at least Copernicus never had to team up with superstars like Johannes Werner and Leonardo DaVinci to attain his goal.” At press time, James was spending his offseason jotting down astronomical measurements in an attempt to construct a unified Theory of Everything."
Coach’s Un-Athletic Son Going To Get Fucking Reamed After Game For Dropping Fly Ball,"PHILADELPHIA—Declaring that they “wouldn’t want to be him right now,” teammates of unathletic outfielder Brett Golliver, son of Coach Bo, confirmed Wednesday that he was going to get fucking reamed out after the game for dropping a routine fly ball in the sixth inning. “Oh my God, it went right through his hands. That poor motherfucker is as good as dead,” said first baseman Tyler Dixon, recalling how Coach Bo glared with silent fury after watching his son overthrow the cut-off man on a potential double play during practice last week. “You can see coach is trying to hold it together, but as soon as that car door closes, he’s going to rip him a new one. I mean, you already know he’s pissed he had to put Tyler in the outfield ’cause he kept bobbling grounders at shortstop. Now that he’s actually cost us a run, the kid’s ears are going to be ringing for a fucking week after this.” At press time, team sources were mumbling “Here we go” after witnessing Coach Bo drop to one knee and grab his son by the shoulders."
Zion Williamson Excited To Play For Team With Proven History Of Frittering Away Generational Talents,"NEW ORLEANS—Claiming it would be an honor to follow in the footsteps of players like Chris Paul and Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson told reporters Tuesday that he’s excited to play for a team with a proven history of frittering away generational talents. “It will honestly be surreal to step on a court where such great players have been wasted year after year. Nobody is better than New Orleans at throwing away a promising career, and now, it’s my turn,” said Williamson, noting that the Smoothie King Center was hallowed ground that has been the graveyard of so many all-time greats’ dreams. “I just know the Pelicans will be able to surround me with sub-par, mismatched teammates and a coaching staff that’ll definitely get fired within the next few years. It’s tough to deal with the uncertainty of the draft, so knowing I’m going to end up with such a consistently disappointing franchise is great. I know they will do everything they can to make me regret ever declaring early.” At press time, Williamson told reporters that he expected to set the franchise record for trade requests."
Adam Gase To Play All 22 Positions After Pushing Out Entire Jets Team,"NEW YORK—Cleaning house after a dispute over the direction the team has taken this offseason, New York Jets head coach and interim general manager Adam Gase announced plans Friday to play all 22 positions on the field next season after pushing out the entire roster. “Coach Gase felt that the franchise needed a fresh start, and he wanted to put together a team that was truly crafted in his image, which is why he will be taking over all quarterbacking, offensive line, and defensive back roles,” said spokesperson Erica Martin, revealing that each of the 53 active Jets players had been cut so that Gase could assume their duties, along with all coordinators, the team president, and the stadium grounds crew. “Coach Gase has a bold vision for the Jets, and he intends to be at the center of every personnel decision, kickoff, screen pass, and blitz. Now that he’s found the perfect roster to fit his system, we are excited to see how this strategy plays out, even if he may be stretching himself thin by acting as team doctor as well.” At press time, the Jets spokesperson had resigned to make way for new Jets spokesperson Adam Gase."
Nationals GM Introduces Players To New Stepmanager,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to ease the team into a new period of transition, Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo took a moment Wednesday to introduce his players to their new stepmanager. “Everyone, this is Dale. You’re going to be seeing a lot more of him from now on, and I want you make him feel nice and welcome,” said Rizzo of the new addition to the National League East club, explaining that the team may have noticed him hanging around recently and joining in on team dinners in the past weeks, and that he would now officially be a permanent fixture of the dugout. “We want to make him a part of the Nationals family. Just give him a chance, and you’ll see that he cares about you just as much as any other manager would—so I want you to give him all your attention and respect. We know you love your normal manager, but Dale cares about you, too. That means no sass and no pranks, got it?” At press time, the Nationals’ new stepmanager had been overheard referring to several outfielders as “a bunch of little shits,” after they forgot to clean up their helmets after batting practice."
Upset Red Sox Fan Demands To Speak To Manager,"BOSTON—Fuming as he referred to the on-field product as “totally unacceptable,” upset Red Sox fan James McCormack pulled aside a Fenway Park employee Friday and demanded to speak to the team’s manager. “Is this the way they treat paying customers? I’m gonna need someone to come up here and explain the level of play I witnessed today,” said McCormack, 38, clarifying that he expected a certain level of performance and professionalism on the field after spending over $100 to watch the Red Sox play the Mariners. “Somebody get Alex Cora up here right now. He better be able to explain why this dogshit bullpen can’t keep a lead to save its goddamn life. I have been a regular visitor to this stadium for over 10 years, but if I don’t get to speak to management right now, or at least get a refund, I’m telling everyone I know to never attend a Red Sox game again.” At press time, Cora was attempting to defuse the situation with an irate McCormack by calling down Red Sox owner John Henry to offer the fan store credit at the Fenway Park shop."
Miami Marlins Looking At Eliminating Unprofitable Baseball Wing Of Organization,"MIAMI—Referring to the sport as a loss leader that “never really captured public interest,” Marlins officials confirmed Wednesday they were exploring the idea of shutting down the organization’s unprofitable baseball wing. “Unfortunately, we may have to cut our losses and shift our focus to more profitable sectors with real growth potential like concessions and apparel,” said CEO Derek Jeter, who clarified that the Marlins would still explore hosting more lucrative sporting events like the Super Bowl or the World Cup. “Marlins Park is a great venue with tons of potential to host big-name concerts and other events that will vastly outperform our lagging baseball division. You can only sink so much money into a project before you have to be honest with yourself and admit it is never going to work out. By doubling down on what the Marlins actually do well, whether it be hosting weddings or converting the locker rooms into a laser tag arena, we can ensure a future for our organization.” At press time, the Marlins announced plans to move forward with phase one of pivoting away from baseball after waves of positive feedback from fans."
Los Angeles Plans To Hold 2028 Olympics In Toronto For The Tax Incentives,"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to lessen the financial strain of hosting the Summer Games, officials from the city of Los Angeles announced Tuesday a new plan to hold the 2028 Olympics in Toronto for the tax incentives. “It just makes the most sense when it comes down to our budget—with a little bit of set dressing, Toronto can be made to look just like L.A.,” said L.A. 2028 Organizing Committee Chairman Casey Wasserman of the detailed plans already underway to create convincing replicas of Los Angeles sports venues from Toronto’s existing Rogers Centre, Varsity Centre, and BMO Field. “We couldn’t really say no to the generous tax breaks that the Canadian government gives you, and Toronto has all the necessary infrastructure and a big-city feel that reads as authentic without all the red tape associated with trying to host the Olympics in Los Angeles proper. We’ll get some shots of generic-looking buildings and some B-roll of the Pacific Ocean and Venice Beach that we can cut to between during televised events, and no one will even be able to tell the difference.” Wasserman also pointed out the fact that the past five Winter Olympics have all been hosted in Canada as well."
"NHL Fans Claim Hockey Way More Fun If You There In Person, On Ice Playing Game","BOSTON—Ardently defending their steadfast loyalty to the sport, NHL fans around the nation gathered Thursday to claim that hockey was way more fun if you’re there in person, on the ice, and actively playing in the game. “Sure, when you watch on TV, the puck looks kind of small and the game is hard to follow, but when you’re right there on the ice swinging your stick as part of a professional team roster, everything’s different,” said local hockey fan Travis Witkins, explaining the immense difference it makes to the active viewing experience when one actually travels to a professional hockey arena, suits up into full pads, helmet, and uniform, and goes skate-to-skate with a team of NHL players. “The feeling of community and camaraderie is so much more intense in person when you’re celebrating and embracing your teammates after a great save or a hard-fought goal. And nothing beats the rush of experiencing an unfolding break as you fly down the ice for a one-on-one shot against the goalie. If more people experienced the NHL this way, hockey would be a way more popular sport.” Witkins did admit that the in-person playing experience was usually aided by pounding a few beers in the parking lot first. "
Kobe Bryant Confident He Could Still Berate Teammates For 20 Minutes A Night,"LOS ANGELES—Asserting that he’d be able to contribute quality scowls and derision to a championship contender, Lakers great Kobe Bryant expressed confidence Tuesday that he could still berate teammates for 20 minutes a night. “I might not be able to intimidate guys at an MVP level anymore, but I could definitely come off the bench as a sixth man and easily throw out 10 or 15 insults every game,” said Bryant, who conceded that his reduced stamina would require him to be more strategic about how he would whittle away at his teammates’ confidence. “When I see guys like LeBron and CP3 out there browbeating people well into their 30s, I know that I could still play the victim in crunch time. Sure, maybe my barbs have lost some of their sharpness, but I still doubt there is anyone in the NBA who can scold at crunch time like I can.” At press time, Bryant challenged several current players on social media by posting a video of himself dunking on his personal trainer while scolding him for “playing defense like a little bitch.”"
"Enes Kanter Grateful To Escape From Oppressive, Failing Dictatorship In New York","PORTLAND, OR—Admitting it was difficult to watch his once-vibrant home fall into complete disarray, Portland Trail Blazers center Enes Kanter confirmed Monday that he was grateful to have escaped the oppressive, failing dictatorship in New York. “It’s disastrous—the leaders are full-on autocrats and there is so little hope left, it’s difficult to see how many people are suffering,” said Kanter, noting his former oppressors at Madison Square Garden were fanatics with no sense of duty to the people they serve, who waste millions of vanity projects to boost their ego while everything crumbles around them. “They just want to hold on to all of the money and power that they can. Unless there is some sort of regime change, things will only continue descending into chaos and despair. I was extremely lucky to get out of that situation—and I know many others who want to get out as well. My heart aches for them, and I pray for the day the people responsible for this suffering will be brought to justice.” At press time, Kanter urged talented young players worldwide to immediately seek asylum lest they be forcibly conscripted by the tyrannical organization in the June draft."
Denver Nuggets Worried They Screwed Up Attempt To Tank For Zion Williamson,"DENVER—Admitting that finishing with the second-best record in the Western Conference has been a bit of a setback for their draft plans, representatives from the Denver Nuggets worried Friday that they had screwed up their attempt to tank for top prospect Zion Williamson. “We thought Zion would be the building block that solidified this team as title contenders, but at some point in the season, we really lost sight of our process,” said general manager Artūras Karnišovas, who expressed embarrassment that the team’s unplanned 50-win season meant it didn’t even have a pick in the 2019 draft, let alone one high enough to draft Williamson. “This season was going to be a throwaway for us—even if we couldn’t finish with the worst record in the league, we figured we’d put ourselves in place to luck out and win the draft lottery. We’ve built our entire future around guys who fit well with Zion’s game, but I guess we didn’t really communicate that these guys should only be playing at 75%. I mean, we might be headed into the second round of the playoffs. That’s the last thing we wanted, so clearly, somebody somewhere really botched this.” At press time, the Nuggets front office had decided the only way to recover from this season was to blow up the entire roster this offseason and start over from scratch. "
Easy-Going Mel Kiper Predicts Teams Will Do Whatever They Feel Is Right And We Shouldn’t Judge Them,"BRISTOL, CT—Cooly asserting that the best choice for everyone at the NFL draft was to “just go with the flow,” an easy-going Mel Kiper predicted Thursday that “the teams will do whatever they feel is right and we shouldn’t judge them.” “Listen, it’s really just not my place to say anything; the teams will pick who they’re gonna pick,” said the calm, lounging ESPN football analyst, explaining that his prediction for the number-one draft pick to be “whoever” was backed up by his knowledge that “the teams have their own styles” and they should do whatever will make them happy. “At the end of the day, football is really just a game. Sure, it’s entertaining to speculate about the draft, but there’s no point in getting upset or trying to control the outcome. In the end, everyone’s a winner if they have fun.” At press time, Kiper had pushed aside his big board, saying “no right choice” for every team as he cracked open a beer and threw his feet up on the desk."
Racine Legion To Select Second Overall In NFL Draft Using Pick Acquired In 1923,"NASHVILLE, TN—In a long-awaited culmination of the bold strategic move made several seasons ago, the Racine Legion will be selecting second overall in the NFL draft Thursday using a pick the team acquired in 1923. “It’s been a tough century for Racine, but with such a high pick, they may finally be able to replace Hank Gillo,” said NFL draft analyst Ben Fennell, adding that the pick provided relief for long-suffering fans of the Legion, who have not seen a competitive team at Horlick Field since Coach Babe Ruetz left in 1924. “It was definitely controversial when the Legion made the call to send Shorty Brown to the Canton Bulldogs in 1923 in exchange for Tex Grigg and a pick 96 years in the future—especially when it was really Fritz Roeseler who had a disappointing season that year—but it seems like all the waiting may be worth it. And fans forget that trading Brown also saved the team $500 in cap space.” Fennell also speculated that the reinvigorated Legion roster might finally have a chance to topple their longtime rivals, the Duluth Kelleys."
Steve Kerr Reminds Warriors To Seem Sad DeMarcus Cousins Injured,"LOS ANGELES—Chastising players for not sticking to their frowns during press conferences, head coach Steve Kerr reminded the Warriors Wednesday to seem sad about center DeMarcus Cousins’ season-ending quad injury. “Remember, guys, nobody likes to be excluded. It might be nice to have a little more spacing on the court, but try not to smile too much and make sure to use a sad voice when discussing this,” said Kerr, who told his team to “give Boogie a fist bump” when he’s sitting on the sidelines and continue including him in the locker room. “I know it’s going to be tough to remember, but try not to run up the score too much. It’s going to make him feel like we don’t need him. I’ve seen way too many hugs and high-fives over the last few days and not enough furrowed brows. We are upset about this, and everyone needs to stick to the plan.” At press time, Kerr had stopped himself after nearly telling reporters this was the best his team looked all year."
Duke Anthropology Professor Devastated To Learn Promising Student Dropping Out,"DURHAM, NC—Fretting over the future of the young man he had once considered a protégé, Duke anthropology professor Edwin Greeley was reportedly devastated Friday upon learning that his most promising pupil, Zion Williamson, was dropping out of school. “Zion is one of the most engaged and thoughtful students I’ve encountered in my 30 years in academia—it’s simply a shame to watch him squander these immense gifts,” said Greeley, adding that under the right tutelage, he had no doubt that Williamson was destined to become a world-renowned anthropologist, perhaps even on par with the likes of Bronislaw Malinowski or Clifford Geertz. “He has a grip on the subtle differences between early Mesoamerican cultures that you just can’t teach. Zion was always staying after class to chat, or coming to my office hours, but now he’s throwing his life away for reasons I can’t begin to understand. I told him that we could arrange some sort of financial aid, but he just said this wasn’t the place for him. I’m afraid the loss of such a promising young academic will be devastating for the whole field. I don’t know why anyone so talented would do this.” At press time, Greeley was trying to convince the burgeoning anthropologist that a $30,000-per-year adjunct professorship was easily within reach for someone with his promise."
Lonzo Ball Chooses CAA To Represent Him As Father,"LOS ANGELES—Calling the decision to part ways with his current paternal figure “difficult but necessary,” Lakers guard Lonzo Ball announced Thursday that he had chosen CAA to represent him as a father. “I met with several suitors, but I really feel like CAA’s integrity and clear commitment to my well-being proved to be the strongest candidate to act as my father moving forward,” said the 21-year-old, who clarified that the talent and sports agency, which is now his legal kin, would be taking over all holiday roles, including buying birthday gifts and carving the turkey on Thanksgiving. “While I certainly appreciate my former father, he was oftentimes unprofessional, and I think it was time for a change of paternity. I honestly couldn’t ask for a better match. CAA is caring and compassionate, but will also defend me with a firm hand, and I know for sure they have my best interests at heart. I can’t wait for them to meet my girlfriend and see the love in their eyes when they meet their new granddaughter.” At press time, Ball had taken to social media to share a picture of him and CAA on a family vacation at a beachside resort in Punta Cana. "
Steve Ballmer Rewards Playoff-Bound Clippers With Complimentary Microsoft Office Upgrades,"LOS ANGELES—Claiming their heart and determination in making the playoffs had earned them a benefits package that included both Microsoft Access and Publisher, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer rewarded the team Wednesday with complementary Office Suite upgrades. “This team defied expectations all year, and I can’t think of a better way to honor them than with the most powerful office and productivity tools on the market,” said the former Microsoft CEO at a press conference, clarifying that players would also received Office Insider accounts, which offer early access to product updates and a direct line of communication to the development team. “This is the full Office 365 Home package, that’s a $99 value, and they deserve every cent. It’s the least I can do after the kind of season they had. This is a special group of guys who deserve premium features, whether it’s a word processor that can save files in any conceivable format or a note-taking app that can easily convert handwriting into text.” Ballmer added that if the Clippers win the NBA championship, their contracts guaranteed them a bonus of brand-new, Windows-equipped Dell desktops."
Bryce Harper Informs Phillies GM Of 2-Week Vacation In August He’d Planned Before Getting Job,"PHILADELPHIA—Worried that he should have warned them about the trip during contract negotiations, Bryce Harper told Philadelphia Phillies general manager Matt Klentak Wednesday that he would be missing two weeks in the middle of August for a vacation he had planned before joining the team. “It’s tough because I already got plane tickets, which are pretty expensive, not to mention the eight-day cruise around the Cayman Islands. There’s just no way I can back out now,” said Harper, claiming he had booked the trip weeks before signing a 13-year, $300-million contract with the team after finding a deal on Priceline that was too good to pass up. “We already booked a scuba diving excursion and put down a deposit for a beach cabana. I hate to put them in a tough spot like this, but I didn’t really know if I was going to be signing with anybody this year when I made all the travel arrangements. My family is so excited about the trip, it would kill them if I had to back out. Things like this just happen sometimes, but I’m sure they’ll find a temp who can fill in for me.” At press time, Harper was telling the team he was excited to start in June after returning from rehab for his offseason ACL tear."
Tom Izzo Calls 2019 Spartans Best Team He’s Ever Threatened With Violence,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN—Crediting his players for being wise enough to do what’s best for their health, Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo told reporters Saturday that this Spartans team was the best he’s ever threatened with violence. “In my 20-plus years at East Lansing, I’ve had the privilege of threatening to pummel some incredible players, but none of them have ever responded to my murderous rants like these guys,” said Izzo, who showered praise on the team for winning the Big 10 tournament, so he didn’t have to follow through on his promise to “choke them out” if they lost. “Whether I’m browbeating them at practice or vowing to kill their parents if they don’t get back on defense, I just know these guys are going to give it their all. I’ve promised to cut up amazing players from Jason Richardson to Denzel Valentine, but seeing how these guys play defense after I threaten to run them over with my car is truly something special.” At press time, Izzo enlisted the help of Spartan alum Draymond Green to give the team a motivational death threat before their Final Four game against Texas Tech."
Total Weirdo Leading Bracket Pool After Picking Teams She Analyzed And Predicted Would Beat The Others,"HAVERFORD, PA—Expressing concerns about her odd behavior over the past few weeks, coworkers of Sheila Gottman confirmed Wednesday that the “total weirdo” was leading their office’s NCAA bracket pool after picking teams she analyzed and predicted would beat the others. “What kind of freak actually reads expert analysis instead of just picking whoever has the cooler mascot?” said graphic designer Mikey Riverol, adding that Gottman’s colleagues were baffled by her eccentric obsession with “high-quality wins” and strength of schedule when she could have just gone with random underdogs like Buffalo and Wofford. “You’re just supposed to pick schools that your friends and relatives went to, not actually look at the teams stats and style of play like a fucking lunactic. Maybe deranged stuff like watching games and judging talent is fun for her, but it kind of ruins it for everyone else.” At press time, several of Gottman’s coworkers were looking to flee an uncomfortable conversation with the nutjob after she came over to ask whether people thought Virginia or Duke had a better shot at making the finals."
"Retiring Rob Gronkowski Admits He’ll Miss Teammates’ Blurry Faces, Fans Spinning Perpetually In The Stands","FOXBORO, MA—In an emotional speech announcing his retirement after a nine-year NFL career with the New England Patriots, Rob Gronkowski reportedly admitted Monday that he’ll miss his teammates’ blurry faces and the fans spinning perpetually in the stands. “It’s really hard to know that I’ll never again stumble off the field, trying to regain my balance while the stadium crowd whirls around me and bright lights hurt my eyes,” said the 29-year-old tight end, adding that he’ll never forget the smell of grass as his head was slammed into the turf by several tacklers or looking up at the dozens of fuzzy, indistinct teammates standing above him waiting for the injury cart to arrive. “I’ll miss the rush of trying to guess which of the 10 balls flying toward me was the one I was supposed to catch, and I’ll definitely pine for the days when I’d arrive at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday in June thinking it was gameday. Mostly, I’ll miss both Tom Bradys, both Bill Belichicks, and both Robert Krafts, who were always there for me, fading in and out of my vision, asking me if I was really in that much pain and if I could suck it up and get back on the field. I’m just thankful I’ll have this constant ringing in my ears to remember my time in the NFL by.” Gronkowski added that he was retiring early in order to enjoy the few years of remembering his career he has left."
Zion Williamson In Panic After Realizing Game Falls On Same Night As Theater Club Production,"COLUMBIA, SC—Frantically pacing and weighing the fallout of skipping the game, Duke forward Zion Williamson was panicking Friday after realizing his NCAA tournament game against North Dakota State falls on the same night as his theater club’s production of In The Heights. “Oh man, oh man, I can’t believe this is happening. I don’t wanna miss the game, but that club is my passion, and I made a promise to this cast,” said Williamson, revealing that Duke’s “amazing theater club” was perhaps the deciding factor that drove him to enroll at the university. “I know RJ [Barrett] and Tre [Jones] will be upset if I skip out, but that club is like my family—they were the first friends I made on campus. We’ve been rehearsing this for months now; I know all my lines and I just got all my blocking down. And the show will be a total train wreck without me. Cory is my understudy for a reason—there’s absolutely no way he can handle the role of Graffiti Pete.” At press time, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was telling Williamson to forget about what everyone else wanted and follow his heart."
NCAA Launches Investigation Into Why It Wasn’t Making Millions Off Recent College Admissions Scandal,"INDIANAPOLIS, IN—In a stern indictment of the cash-grabbing scandal that the student athletics organization was somehow kept completely in the dark about, the NCAA announced Monday the launch of an investigation into why it wasn’t making millions off of the recent college admissions controversy. “After the disturbing revelations that massive bribes were being paid out to people other than us, we’re launching an immediate inquiry into how we possibly missed out on this,” said NCAA president Mark Emmert, who claimed it was a “total failure of the system” that they were not raking in cash from wealthy celebrities when universities like Stanford, Yale, and USC were. “As an organization that always strives to squeeze money out of college athletics, I’m disgusted that this all went on right under our noses without us getting so much as a taste. There’s no way there isn’t some desperate millionaire out there willing to pay for his son to be a benchwarmer on a D1 team. To miss out on such a lucrative pay-to-play scheme goes against everything the NCAA stands for.” At press time, the NCAA had fined and suspended dozens of college coaches for not letting them in on the action."
Giants Consider Drafting Quarterback To Mentor Eli Manning,"NEW YORK—Insisting that they didn’t want to push the 38-year-old signal caller onto the field before he’s ready, Giants general manager Dave Gettleman told reporters Tuesday that the team was considering drafting a quarterback to mentor Eli Manning. “I think it will be good to keep Eli on the bench for a year or two so he can learn the ropes of being an NFL quarterback,” said Gettleman, noting that Manning could really benefit from watching and working with someone who had experience leading a Division I football team. “He’s definitely got the talent, he’s just raw. This will give him time to work on his mechanics and learn the playbook. Sometimes, you just need to be patient with someone like Eli, but it would be a shame if he was never given a chance to reach his true potential.” Gettleman added that, barring injury, Eli probably wouldn’t be ready for the starter role until the 2021 NFL season."
Dirk Nowitzki Shatters Backboard Glass With Powerful Soprano Singing Voice,"DALLAS—Bringing spectators to their feet with a stunning display of showmanship, Dallas Mavericks power forward Dirk Nowitzki shattered the glass of a backboard Wednesday night with his powerful soprano singing voice. “It was mind blowing—I didn’t think he could still get that high at his age,” said Mavericks teammate Tim Hardaway Jr., who recounted his disbelief upon watching thousands of pieces of splintered glass cascade across the hardwood court after the 14-time NBA All Star hit the jaw-dropping crescendo of his refrain. “And to think he was able to nail that note with [Houston Rockets center] Nenê right in his face. No way that guy ever lives it down. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a player finish an aria with such force.” Hardaway added that it was amazing to see the stunned Mavericks fans explode in applause for Nowitzki while showering the court with red roses."
Notre Dame Scandalized After Booster Caught Offering Plenary Indulgences,"SOUTH BEND, IN—In a blatant violation of official NCAA guidelines prohibiting spiritual gifts, sources confirmed Thursday that a Notre Dame booster was caught offering prospective student athletes plenary indulgences. “It’s totally immoral to lure players with the promise of eternal salvation; Notre Dame should be ashamed that any representative of their athletic programs would use such a manipulative recruitment tactic,” said NCAA spokesperson Frieda Percy of longtime Notre Dame booster Arthur McAllen, who was accused of unethical practices after leaked emails revealed he promised highly sought-after football players that they could avoid all divine punishment for their earthly sins by committing to the prominent Catholic university. “These are high school kids, some of them come from difficult backgrounds, and to manipulate them by offering to wipe their sins clean is simply wrong. To offer them all the riches of God’s heavenly kingdom in exchange for a few seasons of football cheapens not only the recruitment process, but also the salvation process as well.” At press time, the scandal had deepend as several players revealed they had been offered a bounty in exchange for baptizing opposing players."
Orioles Creeped Out By Fan Who Followed Them To Spring Training,"SARASOTA, FL—Nervously watching as the suspicious man cheered on the team, the Baltimore Orioles told reporters Tuesday that they were creeped out by a fan who actually followed the ballclub to spring training. “This weirdo in an Orioles jacket has been hanging out around the facilities all week. Did this guy seriously bother to follow us all the way down here?” said first baseman Chris Davis, who claimed the whole team has been unnerved by the idea that some disturbed loner spent hundreds of dollars on travel and accommodations just to watch them play a few meaningless pre-season games. “He’s been here every day just sitting up in the stands. He even brought binoculars so he can watch the players warming up and doing drills on the other side of the field. What kind of creep does that? I hope he didn’t come all the way from Baltimore—this wouldn’t even be worth it if he lived in Florida.” At press time, the Orioles had requested security to remove the fan after he asked if there was any Orioles merchandise available for purchase."
MLB Players Association Advises Remaining Free Agents To Try Adding Keywords Like ‘Baseball’ To Resumés,"NEW YORK—Stressing that the smallest details often help to secure an interview, the MLB Players Association advised the league’s remaining free agents Monday to try adding keywords like “baseball” to their resumés. “You’re going to want to use words that stand out to recruiters like ‘throw’ and ‘glove’—you can even put value-add words such as ‘home run’ or ‘WAR’ in bold to really make them pop,” said executive director Tony Clark, adding that players should also customize cover letters by using the names of the GM and coach as well as providing specific details as to why they want to play for a franchise. “Remember, teams are only going to be spending about 10 seconds on each resumé, so you really need to grab their attention. You can even stretch the truth a bit—don’t go saying you were MVP, because they’ll definitely check a claim like that. But for instance, if you batted seventh, you could embellish by claiming you batted in the middle of the order. Or if you were on the White Sox, just say you played in Chicago.” Clark also urged free agents to make connections with a team by taking a lower-level position like concessions management or ball boy."
Diamondbacks Settle Long-Standing Civil Suit With Offspring Of Bird Hit By Randy Johnson’s Fastball,"PHOENIX—Finally closing a sordid chapter in team history, representatives for the Arizona Diamondbacks announced Friday that the franchise had settled a civil lawsuit with the offspring of a mourning dove who died after being hit by a Randy Johnson fastball during a 2001 spring training game. “We know this was an unspeakably traumatic moment for this family of doves,” said attorney Doug Muhlenberg in a statement on behalf of the Diamondbacks, who went on to lament how long the case had been stuck in litigation and referenced a contentious period which saw a large flock of bird protestors demonstrating outside the courtroom. “While no amount of money can bring back their father, we hope they can move on from this ordeal knowing that justice has been served.” At press time, the Diamondbacks announced plans to prevent similar incidents by installing a mesh netting over the infield. "
Knicks Confident They Have The Cap Space To Ruin 2 Or 3 Promising Careers,"NEW YORK—Insisting that he could easily lure several free agents into giving up their hopes for a championship, Knicks president Steve Mills confirmed Tuesday that he was confident the team had the requisite cap space to ruin two or three promising careers this offseason. “After making moves at the trade deadline to position ourselves, we are poised to sign at least two franchise players who will squander the prime of their careers here,” said Mills, who noted that the 2019 free agency class was “absolutely loaded” with superstar players that could blow out their knees, feud with the front office, or languish in a coaching system that doesn’t fit their talents. “If we play our cards right, we might even be able to convince three marquee players to take a pay cut, surround them with marginal talent, then have them wallow in the dregs of the Eastern conference for the next half decade and never return to their former levels. And with our promising position in the 2019 NBA draft, we might even be able to destroy the career of a highly touted college prospect along with them.” At press time, Kevin Durant was considered a leading contender to be signed and then traded away for extra cap space in 2022."
Climatologists Find Pitchers And Catchers Reporting Further South Every Spring,"WASHINGTON—Warning that swift climate action was needed if local populations were to survive, a study released Friday by the EPA revealed an alarming trend of Major League Baseball pitchers and catchers reporting further south for spring training every year. “It wasn’t long ago that pitchers and catchers could be spotted as far north as Georgia and the Carolinas, but now, due to complex shifts in our planet’s climate, they can only be found in the southern reaches of Florida and Arizona,” read the report in part, cautioning that by 2030, global warming may push baseball spring training as far south as the Caribbean or Central Mexico. “People in the southern United States have long witnessed the beauty of migrating pitchers and catchers in their towns every spring, but their absence is just another side effect of rapidly changing ecosystems. It’s a shame that the next generation of Americans may never know a world where spring training exists.” The study also warned that if prevailing climate trends continue, the baseball season will be shortened to a two-week period at the end of April."
Adam Silver Sends League-Wide Memo Just Asking Players Where The Fuck They Want To Play,"NEW YORK—In response to a litany of high-profile trades and a general sense of dissatisfaction from many star players, NBA commissioner Adam Silver sent out a league-wide message Friday simply asking players “where the fuck [they] want to play basketball.” “Look, we’re just going to put all this bullshit to rest and figure it out now, so everyone send me a list of their top three preferred teams and I’ll try my best to make everyone happy,” said Silver in the memo, insisting that once all 494 players were moved to the team of their choice, he didn’t want to hear any more complaints or demands until everyone was a free agent again in five years. “Everybody’s constantly bitching about getting traded or leaving in free agency, and we’re all sick of your shit. We’re going to make this as painless as possible—do you want to play for the Lakers? Fine, go play for the Lakers. Do you want to be a Knick? Great, pack your bags. Let us know now, so we can all just focus on basketball.” At press time, Silver sent a follow-up message to explain that everyone can’t choose to play for the Warriors."
LeBron And Lakers Hoping Horrible Series Of Failed Betrayals Brings Them Closer As Team,"LOS ANGELES—Responding to a tumultuous trade deadline that saw most of the roster floated for potential deals, LeBron James and his Lakers teammates confirmed Monday that they were hoping this horrible series of failed betrayals would bring them closer as a team. “I’m really trying to stay positive, and I think the fact that I openly tried and failed to push multiple players off this team for Anthony Davis will only make us stronger,” said the four-time NBA MVP, who claimed Lonzo Ball’s father trashing him on national television has only made James respect him more as a teammate. “Sometimes, you just need a cascading series of backstabbing lies, public humiliation, and transparent attempts to replace each other before you realize how great the players around you truly are. I’m sure these young guys feel the same way, and finding out that we don’t want to play with each other at all will take this team to the next level.” At press time, James insisted that the Lakers falling further out of the Western Conference playoff picture would only give them more time to bond this offseason. "
Bryce Harper Asks If Phillies Willing To Move To Another City ,"PHILADELPHIA—Sending a strong signal that the move could swing his decision on where to sign, free agent outfielder Bryce Harper asked Friday whether the Philadelphia Phillies would be willing to relocate to another city. “I’m a big fan of coach [Gabe] Kapler and the roster he’s assembled, but I’d love to see the Phillies make a big move to another city before I commit to playing for them,” said the 2015 National League MVP, adding that he’d even be willing to sign at a lower salary if it would help the team relocate to someplace warm like San Jose or Orlando. “I’m really trying to put myself in the best position and it feels like the Phillies have all the pieces in place, except for the city. Playing with Jake [Arrieta] and Andrew [McCutchen] would be great, but in the end I would still be stuck in Philadelphia. But if they’re able to guarantee they’ll build a new stadium and move the franchise to Omaha, I’ll sign tomorrow.” Harper added that he might be willing to play in Philly if the city traded away the majority of its citizens."
Sean McVay Begs Mother To Let Him Stay Up To Coach Rest Of Super Bowl,"ATLANTA—Promising that he would go to bed “right after” the game ended, Rams head coach Sean McVay begged his mother to let him stay up Sunday night so he can call plays for the rest of Super Bowl LIII. “C’mon, Mom, just one more hour! Pretty please! We’re so close, I can’t just pause the game now,” said McVay, reminding his mother, Cindy, that he doesn’t have to get up early at all tomorrow morning and promising to “do double chores” if she let him finish coaching the biggest game of the year. “It’s not fair that Bill [Belichick] gets to stay up and coach just because he’s older. It’s the Super Bowl, Mom, this is really important. You already made me miss the NFC championship to have dinner with Grandma!” At press time, McVay’s mom had finally relented and told him he could coach for one more quarter if he got into his pajamas."
Super Bowl Halftime Show Marred By Functioning Sound System,"ATLANTA—Disappointing the thousands of fans in attendance as well as an estimated 100 million viewers watching at home, the Super Bowl LII halftime show was marred Sunday by the stadium’s functioning sound system, sources confirmed. “Right from the beginning, the sound was working normally, and unfortunately, I could clearly hear the singing,” said 29-year-old spectator Joe Kessler, adding that the show’s audio feed, which was amplified throughout the stadium and transmitted to television broadcasts with no technical issues, made the performances by Maroon 5, Travis Scott, and Big Boi completely unbearable. “There was definitely nothing wrong with the speakers or the microphones. It’s a shame, because the perfect sound quality just ruined the whole thing.” Kessler added that he hopes Super Bowl organizers would learn from the incident and avoid a similar disaster next year."
Jared Goff Pissed He Had To Miss Friend’s Super Bowl Party For Work,"ATLANTA—Claiming that he had been looking forward to the gathering, Rams quarterback Jared Goff told reporters Sunday that he was totally pissed about missing his friend’s annual Super Bowl party for work. “Dan’s Super Bowl parties are always the best. He has a huge TV and springs for really good beer—it’s such bullshit that I had to miss it because of my job,” said Goff, who complained that he only found out a couple weeks beforehand that he had to travel on Super Bowl weekend. “He makes this awesome chili dip and has a huge plate of homemade nachos to go with it, too. It sucks knowing everyone is there having a good time on Super Bowl Sunday and I have to be here busting my ass. I don’t get to be in the squares pool either. Last year, I won 75 bucks.” At press time, a surly Goff was pacing the sidelines, flipping through his phone, and liking photos of the party on Instagram."
"‘No God, Please Not Now,’ Yells Rapidly Aging Tom Brady As Old Crone’s Spell Begins To Wear Off During Super Bowl","ATLANTA—Begging for mercy while watching his arms wither and skin wrinkle, a rapidly aging Tom Brady cried out for an old crone Sunday as her spell began to wear off in the middle of Super Bowl LIII. “Please, wicked conjurer of misfortune, don’t do this to me now, all I ask is for another quarter of precious youth,” said the New England Patriots quarterback as his muscle mass quickly depleted, his bones grew brittle, and his hair turned a ghostly white before falling out in clumps. “This can’t be happening! You miserable hag, you promised me two more MVP seasons. After all I did for you! The talisman! You told me the blessing was eternal. You promised me youth, immortality! You promised!” At press time, a 141-year-old Brady informed Patriots management of his intentions to continue playing in the 2019 season."
"Nurse Tells Wheelchair-Bound, Concussed Rob Gronkowski He’s At The Super Bowl With All His Friends","ATLANTA—Shouting “touchdown!” while pushing the Patriots’ tight end along the sidelines, nurse Miranda Silva told a wheelchair-bound, concussed Rob Gronkowski Sunday that he was at the Super Bowl with all his friends. “Look, it’s your friend Tom! Your remember Tom, right? And Bill is here, too, Bill is your coach,” said Silva after placing a Nerf football and Gatorade in Gronkowski’s lap and wheeling him around to visit with various members of the Patriots. “Aren’t we having fun? It’s the Super Bowl! You love the Super Bowl. And isn’t that nice that everyone is cheering? They’re all cheering for you! Those people are your fans from when you would run around on the field. That was your favorite thing to do, remember?” At press time, Silva was informing a clapping Gronkowski that the players with the swirl on their helmet were actually the other team."
Inexperienced Puppy Bowl Team Still Hasn’t Opened Eyes Yet,"NEW YORK—Noting that their youth would likely be a major factor in determining the outcome of Puppy Bowl XV, analysts noted Sunday that the inexperienced players on Team Ruff still hadn’t opened their eyes yet. “It’s hard to see how Team Ruff is going to be able to compete with Team Fluff given that its puppies lack experience seeing or hearing since their eyes and ears are still sealed,” said play-by-play announcer Scott Graham, adding that the puppies on Team Ruff were at a further disadvantage because they’d only had a few days since their birth to prepare for the game. “It’s difficult to win a football game when you’re incapable of standing or walking yet. Most of these little pups can barely lift their heads. Sure, they’re young and they’re hungry, but Team Fluff has a definite advantage in having dogs with a full command of their mobility and senses. But even if they don’t win the championship, this game is going to offer the puppies on Team Ruff some valuable experience in trying to urinate or defecate on their own.” At press time, the outlook for the inexperienced Team Ruff had decreased even further after the newborn puppies’ mother ate most of the litter at halftime."
Sean McVay Reveals Bill Belichick Occasionally Texted Him Photos Of Dead Animals After Games,"ATLANTA—Calling the correspondence enlightening and a “window into his mind,” Rams head coach Sean McVay told reporters Tuesday that Bill Belichick occasionally texted him photos of dead animals after regular season games. “It’s always great when a legend like coach Belichick reaches out to you with a picture of a disemboweled cow,” said the 33-year-old signal caller, describing an encouraging message Belichick sent him after the Rams dropped back-to-back games, which featured a passage from The Satanic Bible along with practical advice on how to properly hex opponents. “We can all use some positive reinforcement, and I’m really grateful that he took the time to share close-up photos of people suffering from the bubonic plague. One time, he just sent me a video of a pool of blood. It’s flattering to know that he sees a little bit of himself in me—I’ve tried my best incorporate his words of wisdom into my coaching process.” At press time, McVay had taken to social media to share a “really goofy” screenshot of a text message in which Belichick posed in front of the Cambodian Killing Fields."
Tony Romo Realizes He Should Have Used Ability To Read Defenses Back When He Was Still Playing,"ATLANTA—Admitting that relying on the skill set was fairly obvious in hindsight, CBS commentator Tony Romo realized Friday that he probably should have used his ability to read defenses back when he was still playing. “Aw, jeez, you know, being able to determine whether the secondary was staying in man or dropping into zone would have been super helpful back when I was under center,” said Romo, who acknowledged for the first time that his aptitude for identifying blitz packages and dissecting coverage schemes would likely have improved his play at quarterback. “Honestly, it’s kind of a shame I didn’t take the things I learned from watching all those hours of tape and apply them to the actual games—because it turns out, knowing exactly what the other team is going to do is a pretty big advantage. Gosh, I probably could have even avoided a bunch of those sacks and injuries that forced me into early retirement.” Romo added that in retrospect, it easily could have been him catching Patriots cornerback Jason McCourty without safety help over-the-top on the second play from scrimmage next week."
Rejection From Hall Of Fame Sends Roger Clemens Spiraling Into Performance-Enhancing-Drug Binge,"HOUSTON—Furious after once more failing to receive enough votes for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, seven-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens reportedly went off on a reckless performance-enhancing-drug bender Wednesday. “As soon as I found out I wasn’t getting in, I started hitting the HGH pretty hard, and before I knew it, I was shooting up the ’roids again, too,” said the musclebound 450-pound former All-Star pitcher, his forehead veins pulsing as he became visibly angry and began punching holes in the walls of his living room littered with used syringes. “I just needed some kind of release, and that’s usually when I relapse with the PEDs. But you know what? Maybe there’s a healthier way to deal with this. Maybe I should just go on up to Cooperstown, rip the fucking door off that place, and start tearing shit up. Turn me down seven years in a row, will they? This is all their fault. My hair is falling out in clumps, I can’t get an erection, and those assholes are to blame! I will not be denied what is mine!” At press time, reports confirmed a confrontation with law enforcement in which a frenzied Clemens unleashed a deafening, demonic scream, overturned a police cruiser with his bare hands, and swatted away the bullets of hastily retreating officers."
Patriots Score 2 Touchdowns Against Chiefs In Preemptive Strike Before AFC Championship Game,"KANSAS CITY, MO—In an effort to gain a competitive advantage against a formidable opponent, the New England Patriots scored two touchdowns against the Chiefs Friday in a preemptive strike before Sunday’s AFC Championship Game. “We knew we had to do something to catch them off guard, so we ran a no-huddle offense before they stepped onto the field and were able to get 16 points on the board after those two-point conversions,” said Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who overcame several dropped passes and a botched snap before finding the end zone twice. “Hopefully it’ll be tough for the Chiefs to overcome this deficit—especially if we win the coin toss and can put another score on the board before they even get a possession. I think it should give our defense the opportunity to pin their ears back and get after the QB. Mahomes tends to get careless with the ball when he’s playing from behind.” At press time, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid had already squandered all of the team’s timeouts before kickoff. "
Tom Brady Feeling Guilty After Gorging Self On Full Order Of Kansas-City-Style Tap Water ,"KANSAS CITY—Expressing regret and shame for having “completely overindulged,” New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady confessed feelings of guilt Friday after gorging himself on a full order of Kansas-City-style tap water. “Ugh, I’ve compromised my own standards and my responsibility to my team by devouring an entire 32-ounce glass of non-ionized fluid,” said Brady, who added that he couldn’t believe the locals considered such a massive portion to be a normal-sized serving. “And I have to tell you, K.C.-style tap water is just so thick and tangy that I don’t know how I even managed it. I’m feeling utterly bloated and lethargic—I don’t know how I’m going to hit the gym in three minutes. I admit it—it was delicious and I just wanted to lick up every drop and couldn’t stop myself. I wish someone had cut me off, because I demolished that tumbler of water with reckless abandon. Oh, God, it’s all over my shirt and face.” Brady then announced that he would be lying down in his hyperbaric chamber until game time."
NBA Ref Petrified After Seeing Depiction Of Own Death While Looking Under Replay Hood,"SAN ANTONIO—Staring into the distance with his mouth agape and sweat beading on his forehead, NBA referee JB Derosa was reportedly terrified Monday after seeing a depiction of his own death while looking under the replay hood. “JB was under there a while on what seemed like a routine call, then all of a sudden, he pulled his head out violently. He was shaking, and he had gone completely pale,” said fellow referee Sean Wright, adding that Derosa was in a fugue-like state and completely ignored him when he asked if he was okay, only to later reveal to team physicians that he glimpsed a brief, spectral vision of his future demise in between frames of an attempted block by LaMarcus Aldridge. “After I grabbed his shoulder, he turned around and just started muttering ‘No, no, how?’ as his lower lip trembled in fear. Then his nose started bleeding. We still don’t know what the call was.” At press time, a frantic Derosa was desperately trying to discourage the NBA from holding its All-Star weekend in Charlotte, NC this year."
Joe Buck Tears Rotator Cuff After Awkward Throw Down To Sideline,"DALLAS—Grimacing and clutching at his shoulder, Fox NFL announcer Joe Buck tore his rotator cuff after an awkward throw down to the sideline during the second quarter of the Buccaneers vs. Cowboys game. “You hate to see an announcer go down like that. Especially on such a routine throw down to Erin to check the field conditions. He’s made that throw a thousand times,” said commentator Troy Aikman, adding that Buck went down hard after stumbling over the first few words of the sentence and was still on the ground writhing in pain after the update was over. “You could see something was wrong the second the words left his mouth, it just didn’t look right. He twisted awkwardly as he said ‘on the sideline’ and then this shock of pain crossed his face. This isn’t as bad as when I saw Al Michaels tear his ACL on a touchdown call, but there is no way Joe is going to be announcing for at least a month.” At press time, Aikman was being treated for a concussion after attempting to analyze the play call on a third-down conversion."
NFL Defends Right To Subject Eric Reid To Random Stop-And-Frisks,"CHARLOTTE, NC—Categorically denying allegations that the tactic was unconstitutional and unfairly targeted players who protested the national anthem, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement Sunday defending the NFL’s right to subject Panthers safety Eric Reid to random stop-and-frisk searches. “We’re simply trying to keep the game clean and provide a safe environment that benefits all our players. In this case, we received an anonymous tip about a suspicious-looking individual with a mask obscuring his face acting aggressively towards our players and decided to inform the proper authorities,” said Goodell at a press conference in which he advised Reid against loitering at the line of scrimmage or other sensitive areas to avoid similar incidents moving forward. “He was described holding an unidentified object in his hands, a description which prompted officials to detain Mr Reid and perform a thorough strip-search. We were all relieved to discover it was just a football, this time, but no single player is above the code of conduct.” Reid and 11 of his teammates are currently being held for questioning on suspicion of gang-related activity after eyewitnesses observed them wearing clothes bearing the same colors and threatening logo."
Raiders Announce Plan To Play 2019 Home Games In Jon Gruden’s Backyard,"OAKLAND, CA—Quashing rumors that the team was looking to make an early exit for Las Vegas, the Oakland Raiders announced plans Wednesday to play the entirety of their 2019 home schedule in Head Coach Jon Gruden’s backyard. “This is really the perfect venue for this this team—in fact, I think playing in my yard will provide a unique home field advantage like nowhere else in the league,” said Gruden, adding that the proposed half-acre plot nestled in the Bay Area suburbs boasted a beautiful natural surface and enough improvised seating to accommodate dozens of hardcore Raiders faithful. “Make no mistake, this place is going to be rocking. I mean, I can’t wait to see Derek Carr out there delivering touchdown strikes from way up there on the deck. Plus, fans are just going to love the new amenities. We’ve made some room for the the Black Hole over there by the garbage cans. We’ve got 3.5 bathrooms and a crockpot full of chili in the house. Seriously, I don’t think there’s a better way to spend a Sunday.” At press time, several Raiders players admitted that despite the treacherous clothesline and exposed tree roots, playing in Coach Gruden’s backyard was still far preferable to games on a “goddamn baseball field.”"
Entirety Of Browns Dawg Pound Euthanized Following Rabies Outbreak,"CLEVELAND—Claiming it was the most humane way to deal with their suffering fans, the Cleveland Browns announced Tuesday that they had euthanized the entirety of the Dawg Pound following a rabies outbreak. “They were a part of our Browns family, and we’re heartbroken over cutting their lives short, but putting them down was the only option,” said team owner Jimmy Haslam, who revealed the Browns’ concern was piqued after several members of the Dawg Pound began chewing on plastic seats and salivating uncontrollably, but that by the time the outbreak was discovered it was too late for any cure to be administered. “We have to put the safety of our fans first. The Dawg Pound may have still seemed fun and approachable, but many were getting aggressive, and it was only a matter of time before they bit someone. It may seem cruel, but their quality of life was never going to be the same—they were battling constant seizures, and the hydrophobia resulting from the rabies was making it impossible for them to drink beer.” Haslam, who emphasized the sadness of the mercy killing, assured fans that they could take comfort in knowing the Dawg Pound would never have to suffer through another Browns’ game again."
U.S. Military Honors Sacrifices Of NFL Players By Wearing Jerseys Throughout December ,"ARLINGTON, VA—In recognition of the brave and altruistic Americans who risk their health and safety for the greater good, Pentagon officials announced Thursday that the U.S. military would honor the sacrifices of NFL players by wearing their jerseys throughout December. “Every week, these men are out there on the gridiron, putting their bodies on the line for our country. Having our soldiers wear these jerseys and caps is the least we can do to show our support,” said Pentagon spokesperson Robert D’Amato, who announced that all active-duty soldiers would be sporting gear from all 32 teams to raise awareness of the people who put their lives aside to preserve the American way of life. “These men leave their homes and their families and travel to cities across the country to uphold our nation’s traditions. They are battered and bruised for years, their lives often cut short while we sit back in our barracks and enjoy our freedom. Some of them are never the same after they end their service, and yet we take them for granted. Hopefully, this small gesture shows that the soldiers and officers of the U.S. military know who the true heroes really are.”"
MLB Hoping To Boost Attendance At League Meetings With ‘Star Wars’ Night,"LAS VEGAS—In an effort to generate more enthusiasm among owners and general managers for the sparsely attended event, Major League Baseball introduced announced a new “Star Wars Night” Monday to boost attendance at this year’s winter meetings. “In the past, we’ve had problems drawing a full crowd to these meetings, so we are trying to make things a little more fun, especially for the younger owners,” said commissioner Rob Manfred, who revealed that each owner who attended received a free bobblehead of Luke Skywalker. “Some of the attendees aren’t big fans of baseball and complain that the meetings are slow and boring, but they love Star Wars. You can tell by their huge smiles that they had a great time interacting with their favorite characters such as Darth Vader, Storm Troopers, and Chewbacca. The winner of the costume contest receives a movie poster of The Last Jedi signed by the cast, and a local orchestra will play “The Imperial March” during the lunch break. Plus, owners can also pay $10 extra for a collectible Yoda cup that comes with free beer refills.” Manfred added that Theo Epstein was scheduled to give a presentation on “lightsabermetrics” that analyzes the connection between MLB attendance and Star Wars box office returns."
Modern-Day Rudy Fulfills Dream Of Showering With Notre Dame Football Team,"NOTRE DAME, IN—Welling up with emotion upon finally setting foot on the hallowed tile surface, college senior Anthony Harper fulfilled his lifelong dream Saturday after finally being allowed to shower with the Notre Dame football team. “A lot of people told me I would never make it into these showers, but I knew that if I worked hard and never quit, I have what it takes to strip down and lather up with Notre Dame football,” said Harper, who received an ovation from the team after coach Brian Kelly tossed him some conditioner and told him to “get on in there.” “Every week for the last three years, I would sit on the bench in this locker room and watch the team shower, wishing I could be in there with them. I always thought I was too small to soap up with Notre Dame, but it just goes to show that with enough grit and determination, anyone can achieve their lifelong dream to bathe with a college football team.” Harper added that finally getting to shower with Notre Dame was made even more special by having his entire family there to witness it."
Health Experts Say Tackle Football Poses Little Risk For Children Whose Brains Already Don’t Work That Well,"CHICAGO—In an announcement perceived as a major reassurance to parents of children with low cognitive abilities, subpar reasoning skills, or who are simply “not all there,” top national pediatric health experts released a report Monday which claims that full-contact football poses little risk to children whose brains already don’t work too well. “Tackle football has long been known to be a high-risk sport, particularly for children under 12, but face it—some of these poor little guys are real knuckle-draggers, so why take away their fun? I mean, what do they have to lose?” said University of Chicago childhood development expert Dr. Maureen Clifford, whose neuropathological research led her to the conclusion that the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by repeated or severe head impacts in children is mitigated by more than 90 percent in cases where the youth presented signs of being a huge dumbass and clearly had a couple screws loose already. “Of course, CTE is the most significant danger when it comes to contact sports like football, and the ages 10 to 18 are especially crucial to healthy neurological growth. But what are the symptoms of CTE? Mood swings, difficult thinking, memory loss? If that sounds like your kid, it’s because your precious little dude is already kind of a bonehead. Blocking, tackling, and getting hit on crossing routes are the least of the reasons why they’re acting like such a goddamn idiot all the time.” The study concluded that, for many of these halfwits, football is in fact their only shot at success."
Yankees Avoid Luxury Tax By Moving Franchise To Offshore Location,"ISLAND HARBOR, ANGUILLA—In an effort to cut down on the crippling costs of their $190 million roster, the New York Yankees avoided Major League Baseball’s luxury tax this week by moving the franchise to an offshore location. “The Yankees have called New York home for 115 years, but unfortunately, moving the staff and stadium to this Caribbean island is the only way to shield ourselves from the MLB’s punishing tax system and maintain acceptable levels of profitability,” said owner Hal Steinbrenner, adding that while he knows New Yorkers will be upset about the move, the minimal tax burden and lower wages of Anguilla were necessary to succeed in the highly competitive modern baseball environment. “Yankees fans will still be able to enjoy the team they love on nationally televised games or the YES Network, and all season ticket holders will be able to make the 1,600-mile journey by plane or boat for every game. Unless, of course, New York would be willing to give us $25 million in luxury tax breaks.” At press time, Boston Red Sox ownership was responding to the news by scouting potential stadium locations in Liechtenstein."
Original Voice Of NBA Buzzer Passes Away,"SCOTTSDALE, AZ—After a lifetime spent defining the sound of basketball in America, Roman Sullivan, the original voice of the NBA buzzer, passed away at the age of 83, sources confirmed Thursday. “Today, we mourn a longtime member of the NBA family. You always knew it was either the half or end of a game when you heard Mr. Sullivan’s deafening scream echo across the arena,” said commissioner Adam Silver of the NBA legend, who was employed as the live buzzer at Minneapolis Lakers games before recording the low, continuous humming in 1962 for use in arenas across the country. “Today’s generation of buzzer voices grew up imitating and wanting to be Mr. Sullivan, you can still hear his influence every time a quarter ends. Whether it was during Michael Jordan’s iconic game winner in 1993, or countless other buzzer-beaters, Roman’s voice is etched in NBA history.” Silver also apologized for the NBA relying on Sullivan for decades but only paying $150 for use of his iconic voice."
Manny Machado Denies Playing Dirty After Late Slide Into Pitcher’s Mound,"MILWAUKEE—Emphasizing he was not going to apologize for playing hard, Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Manny Machado denied that he was a dirty player after a late slide into Corey Knebel on the pitcher’s mound. “I wasn’t trying to hurt him, that was just a normal spikes-first dive into someone’s shin at the pitcher’s mound. I’m just trying to win like everyone else,” said Machado, adding that it isn’t against the rules to throw a handful of dirt into a shortstop’s eyes on your way to third base. “All I was trying to do was make sure he wouldn’t be able to pitch for the rest of the playoffs. He’s doing his job and I am doing mine. If you think it’s dirty of me to bowl over a player trying to make a catch in right field, then call it dirty. I call it playing baseball.” At press time, Machado was trying to explain that charging the first baseman while swinging your bat was an “unwritten rule of the game.”"
Texas Rangers Asking Taxpayers To Cover 60% Of Bribes Related To New Stadium,"ARLINGTON, TX—Admitting that the billions of dollars needed to grease the wheels required a joint effort, the Texas Rangers requested Wednesday that taxpayers cover roughly 60 percent of bribes related to the construction of their new stadium. “Between contractors, vendors, and local law enforcement, there’s a lot of under-the-table costs here that we can’t take care of by ourselves,” said Rangers chairman Ray C. Davis, explaining that the team would need to spend millions upfront just to placate the Arlington city council before they could even think about lining the pockets of state legislators and construction crews. “We want to keep the team in Texas, but if the public can’t spare taxpayer money to cover the very real kickback costs, we might be forced to move to a more accommodating city. However, if voters do support the funding, we predict the new stadium will inject millions of dollars back in the local graft economy.” Davis also emphasized that the project would create hundreds of high-paying no-show construction jobs for the siblings of county officials."
Sprinter Feels Like An Idiot After Finding Out About Jogging,"TULSA, OK—Wondering why nobody bothered to tell him about the far easier alternative this whole time, sprinter Eric Powell admitted Thursday that he feels like a total idiot after finding out about jogging. “Jesus, I can’t believe I’ve been working my ass off, pushing myself to run as fast as humanly possible when I could’ve been trotting around the track this whole time,” said Powell, who explained that he learned about the slower form of running when he saw several joggers and, assuming that they needed help learning how to sprint, approached them and asked what they were doing. “I was blown away—all these years I thought the only way to run and get in shape was to move super quickly. It didn’t even occur to me that I could go at a much more enjoyable middle pace.” At press time, Powell had given up on running entirely after he discovered walking."
Panicked Falcons Discover Scratch In Mercedes Benz Stadium,"ATLANTA, GA—Pacing and cursing as they searched in vain for a note, the entire Falcons roster reportedly panicked Friday after finding a massive scratch in Mercedes Benz Stadium. “Dammit, who did this? It’s halfway down the whole thing! Christ, this is going to cost a fortune to fix,” said a distressed Matt Ryan as he attempted to buff out the scratch with the crumpled-up end of his sleeve. “This was a brand new stadium, too. It’s barely a year old and it’s already ruined. It’s so obvious, too, everybody is going to see this big, ugly gash during the game. Man, [Coach] Dan [Quinn] is gonna flip his shit.” At press time, the Falcons had been distracted from the scratch after noticing someone had pried the Mercedes Benz symbol off the front of the stadium."
NFL Urges Pass Rushers To Try Reaching Peaceful Resolution With Quarterbacks Before Resorting To Tackling,"NEW YORK—In an effort to find a more constructive way to cost the other team yardage, the NFL asked pass rushers on Wednesday to seek amicable resolutions with opposing quarterbacks before resorting to a tackle. “Instead of immediately stooping to a violent hit, defensive ends and linebackers should take an empathetic stance and try talking the quarterback out of his attempt to throw the ball,” said NFL vice president of human resources Kim McFadden, adding that pass rushers should use “I statements” to keep quarterbacks from feeling threatened while defenders asserted their own feelings as to why the signal caller needs to take a knee and lose a down. “Tackling should always be the last choice when dealing with a quarterback intent on tossing a pass or running for a first down. If players cross the line of scrimmage with an open mind, make eye contact, and calmly present their case, I think they’ll find that most QBs are receptive to spiking the ball or throwing it away.” McFadden admitted that defenders may still be forced to take down their opponent, but should try to depersonalize the attack and limit destructive blows to the quarterback’s torso, neck, ankles, and head."
Troy Aikman Warns Fans About Comparing Concussions Between Eras,"LOS ANGELES—Noting that new rules and increased athleticism have transformed the NFL, former quarterback Troy Aikman warned fans Wednesday about comparing today’s concussions to the brain injuries from earlier NFL eras. “It’s just an entirely different game now. Sure, there are guys doing incredible harm to their brains today, but you can’t compare it to the debilitating damage players suffered in the 70s and 80s,” said Aikman, adding that there was no way to compare the strength of modern concussions until players’ brains degrade with neurodegenerative disease over the next few decades. “Some might say Terry Bradshaw had the greatest concussions of all time, but there’s really no way to compare them to the brain injuries of Peyton Manning or Ben Roethlisberger. Can you say Joe Namath would have had the same concussions if he were being hit by people like J.J. Watt? The NFL is looking at a whole different kind of head trauma now.” Aikman added that in another concussion era, he might have won eight Super Bowls with the Vikings instead of just six."
New NFL Safety Rule Encourages Players To Take Out More Aggression Off The Field,"NEW YORK—Explaining that the regulation would help provide a safer game environment, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell held a press conference Tuesday to announce a new rule that encourages professional football players to take out their aggression off the field. “Player safety is our chief priority, so rather than risking injury to a quarterback, we’d strongly prefer league members release all their anger at home or perhaps at a local bar,” said Goodell, insisting the new policy would result in fewer roughing-the-passer penalties and help the league deliver a more family-friendly product. “We’ve added an extra 20 pages to the rulebook that outline the many ways players can get the hostility out of their systems by attacking people off the field, and we hope they’ll step into the locker room Sunday absolutely free of stress.” At press time, sources confirmed three NFL players had been arrested on charges of domestic violence, causing Goodell to hail the new rule as an “unequivocal success.”"
Sean McDermott Wonders If He Still Needs To Act Angry Even If Everyone Already Knows Bills Going To Lose,"BUFFALO, NY—Watching his team fail miserably while attempting to convert yet another third down and long, Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott wondered Sunday if he still needed to act angry even though everyone already knew the Bills were going to lose. “I mean, everybody saw this coming, should I even bother raising my voice or acting like I’m disappointed? Who would I be fooling?” said McDermott, noting that it would be pretty disingenuous to call out his players as if he or anyone else expected anything other than total incompetence on the field. “I guess I could make a whole show of yelling or throwing my headset and kicking something over, but everybody would see right through that charade. It would honestly be kind of embarrassing to even pretend I thought we had a chance at winning. People would think I’m a moron.” At press time, McDermott had issued a half-hearted “let’s go” to his offense followed by three apathetic claps."
Emotional Le’Veon Bell Reveals Holdout A Result Of Forgetting How To Run,"PITTSBURGH—Breaking down while discussing the horrible condition behind his absence, an emotional Le’Veon Bell revealed to reporters Tuesday that his ongoing holdout was a result of forgetting how to run. “People are attacking me, saying this is about greed or ego, but the truth is I’ve completely blanked on how to move forward rapidly,” said a tearful Bell, who claimed he first discovered the problem during a private workout when, after a handoff, he found himself paralyzed by fear and confusion, unable to advance the ball down the field even without defenders blocking him. “I want to be out there competing with my teammates, but every time I try to run, I end up tripping, walking backwards, or just spinning in circles. Trying to overcome this and learn how to move my feet in quick succession again has been the most painful struggle of my career.” Bell added that he was committed to the team and was working with forward-movement specialists to return as quickly as possible."
Russell Wilson Asks Seahawks To Modify Play Where He’s Immediately Tackled By Six Players,"SEATTLE—Expressing some reservations about allowing the defense instant, unfettered access to the backfield, Russell Wilson asked the Seahawks Tuesday to modify a read-pass-option play where he’s immediately tackled by six players after receiving the snap. “I’m happy to run whatever the coaching staff draws up, but I think we can adjust this play a little so I can take more than three steps without getting pounded into the turf,” said Wilson, explaining to his coaches that perhaps one of the Seahawks’ offensive lineman could attempt to stand in the way of the oncoming pass rushers. “There is a lot to like about this play, but we could try working in some play-action or a quick slant pass before the pocket dissolves and I’m hit from three different angles. At the very least, we should only call the plays where I get sacked before I can start my progression reads a few times per game.” At press time Pete Carroll had heeded his quarterback’s advice and drawn up a new play where Wilson scrambles left and right multiple times and then throws the ball out of bounds."
Matthew Berry Admits He Just Drafts Fantasy Players Whose Names He Recognizes,"BRISTOL, CT—Offering a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into his decision-making process, ESPN fantasy football expert Matthew Berry admitted Tuesday that he just drafts fantasy players whose names he recognizes. “When putting together my perfect fantasy lineup, it can be hard to keep track of so many players I don’t know, so I usually just go with the people whose names sound kind of familiar because that means they are probably pretty good,” said Berry, adding that if he recognizes someone’s name that means they are most likely a Pro Bowler or really popular, because he wouldn’t really know which players are bad. “I’m a big Redskins fan, so I’ll often just draft players I like from that team. Sometimes, looking for people I know does backfire. Last year, I wanted to draft Peyton Manning because people said that name a lot when talking about football, but then on draft day I found out he was retired.” Berry added that if fantasy football players didn’t recognize most of the names, there was usually a points projection on each website that was pretty helpful."
Fan Going To See How First Few Games Go Before Declaring Moral Objection To Watching NFL,"LAKE WORTH, FL—Preparing to denounce football as a dangerous sport that takes advantage of athletes as soon as he could determine his favorite team had no hope of making the playoffs, local Dolphins fan Brad Abbott announced Sunday that he was going to check out the first couple games of the season before declaring a moral objection to watching the NFL. “I was going to come out and say the league is indefensible due to its reaction to domestic abuse allegations, but then we drafted Minkah Fitzpatrick and signed Danny Amendola, so maybe I’ll see what happens first,” Abbott said, asserting that he would immediately take a vocal stance against the league by calling out its policies on social protests the moment the Dolphins hit a three-game losing streak. “The NFL’s response to CTE research has been abhorrent, and as soon as the Dolphins are statistically out of the playoffs, I’ll be boycotting them. I mean, how immoral of a person do you have to be to support Roger Goodell if your team has no shot at the post-season?” Abbott promised that he would not be watching the Super Bowl this season unless someone invited him to a party or the matchup was really good."
Aging Tom Brady Decides To Conserve Energy By No Longer Returning Kicks,"FOXBORO, MA—Phasing out one of the most famous and explosive parts of his game, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady told reporters Thursday that he plans to protect his body this season by no longer returning kicks. “I’m not in my 20s anymore, when I could return four or five kicks a game. I just don’t have the stamina to start a drive after a 30-yard punt return without getting winded,” said Brady, who has been beloved by Patriots fans for his elusiveness, lightning-fast speed, and electrifying spin moves. “As you get older, you have to learn your body’s limits, and I just can’t juke past tacklers and sprint down the sidelines like I used to. I won’t rule out returning a few punts during the playoffs if we need a spark, but after almost 20 years as the Patriots’ return man, it’s time someone else took over.” Sources confirmed that while Brady intends to stay fresh by mostly focusing on passing, he has no plans to give up long snapping."
Shohei Ohtani Regrets Not Researching Which Teams Were Good Before Signing With Angels,"ANAHEIM, CA—Kicking himself for not considering the potential consequences of his hasty career decision, Shohei Ohtani told reporters Wednesday that he regrets not researching which teams were good prior to signing with the Los Angeles Angels. “Man, looking back, I definitely should have done a quick Google search for ‘good major league baseball teams’ or something like that, because this is a major waste of my talent,” said the Japanese baseball phenom who, despite being enthusiastically courted by several other MLB teams, decided to sign with the Angels after just assuming they were probably good since they are a big-market team. “This was just laziness on my part, and now I’m gonna regret this for a while. I mean, I’m in the prime of my career, I could have signed with anyone I wanted. At the very least, I should have asked someone, ‘Hey, are the Angels good or bad?’” Ohtani also told reporters that more disappointing than anything was discovering he was actually going to play in some shitty town called Anaheim instead of Los Angeles. "
Nick Foles Reveals He Turned Down Big Volunteer Opportunities At Church To Remain With Eagles,"PHILADELPHIA—Revealing that after the Super Bowl he could have taken over several big-time bake sales, Nick Foles told reporters Thursday that he turned down significant volunteer opportunities at church to remain with the Philadelphia Eagles. “I had my fair share of great offers this offseason, but in the end, I decided I would rather stay with my teammates in Philly than chase a leadership role heading up food drives at St. Mary’s or Blessed Sacrament,” said Foles, admitting that he couldn’t leave the team he won a championship with even if he was offered something as prestigious as the youth pastor position. “I could have secured a major deal with some top-level churches to lead their community outreach program, but I knew my place was right here with the Eagles. Don’t get me wrong, it was really tough to walk away from a chance to play the organ at Easter mass or even lead a choir, but at the end of the day, my sense of loyalty to my teammates won out.” When reached for further comment, all local churches had denied making any offers of any kind to Nick Foles."
Baseball Statisticians Unveil New Analytics Model Measuring Precise Amount Of Joy They Suck From The Game,"PHOENIX—Saying the breakthrough would change baseball statistics forever, the Society Of American Baseball Research unveiled a new analytics model Friday that measures the precise amount of joy their work sucks from the game. “For years, we’ve wondered exactly how much fun we drain from baseball, but finally, by combining the models from advanced statistics like OPS+ and BABIP, we were able to pinpoint the exact degree to which sabermetrics have turned America’s pastime into a miserable experience for casual and diehard fans alike,” said statistician and model co-developer Bill James, explaining that the model was capable of calculating a fan’s enjoyment down to the third decimal point, and measures the minute-by-minute fluctuations as they are bombarded with precisie, joyless stats like WAR and wRC+. “This model can pinpoint the exact moment in which baseball goes from an exciting spectator sport to a numbing slog, devoid of all mystery and drama. Best of all, with this new measurement, statisticians can see their precise performance and fine tune their cold, dispassionate analysis to maximise joy loss.” At press time, the statisticians had unveiled a new statistic to determine how much comparative joy loss a stat provided against a baseline generic joy loss stat."
Andrew Luck Vows To Bring Indianapolis Fans Another Great Pizza Ad,"INDIANAPOLIS—Stressing the difficulty of following in the footsteps of an all-time legend, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck vowed Thursday to bring Indianapolis fans another great pizza ad. “It’s been far too long since Colts fans have been able to call a pizza ad campaign their own, but I’m going to do my best to bring them the high-quality commercials they deserve,” said Luck, explaining that he always dreamed of standing on the soundstage and proudly holding up a slice of pepperoni pizza just like one of his heros. “Peyton Manning gave Indianapolis one of the best pizza promotion runs the NFL has ever seen. I may not be able to live up to that, but Colts fans should know I’m reading scripts and working on my pie-flipping mechanics every day to make sure I honor his legacy.” At press time, Luck was projected to be out for the rest of the season after tearing his rotator cuff while opening a pizza box."
Nation Would Be Totally Fine Just Doing World Series Now,"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging that they got the point and were ready to move on to something else, Americans from across the country confirmed Wednesday that it would be fine for Major League Baseball to just start the World Series right now. “Honestly, why not just pick a couple teams and start playing? We’ve been watching for four months already, we know who’s good, so we might as well wrap this thing up,” said Lawrence, KS resident Jeff Moreno, who echoed the sentiment of millions while explaining how playing another two months of baseball seemed like overkill at this point, and that they were going to start watching football and basketball pretty soon. “At the very least, they should skip to the championship series and make them single-game play-ins—nobody is going to argue with that. Everyone who wanted to go see a game this season has gone by now, and we’ve seen enough home runs. Let’s cross this off the list before it gets cold outside.” At press time, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred had agreed with the rest of the nation and announced that the Houston Astros would defeat the Chicago Cubs 4-2 to become the new World Series champions."
LeBron James Crestfallen After Learning L.A. Doesn’t Have Any Rock And Roll Museums,"LOS ANGELES—Disappointed that his new home lacked Cleveland’s amazing variety of cultural institutions, Lakers power forward LeBron James was reportedly crestfallen Tuesday after learning Los Angeles does not have any rock and roll museums. “I always loved the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland and just kind of assumed a big city like L.A. would have a few of them, or least at least an even nicer one. It’s really a bummer,” said James, who also complained about his fruitless search around the city for a World War II submarine as beautifully restored as Cleveland’s USS Cod. “Honestly, it’s been a big let down—none of the neighborhoods I’ve been to are as cool and arty as the Flats and Tremont. Cleveland had the lakefront, too. L.A. doesn’t have any great lakes, and I haven’t spotted a single James Garfield Monument.” James did admit that while L.A. can’t compare to Cleveland on the culture front, it’s far better than the shithole city of Miami."
Bill Belichick Announces This Final Season He Will Coach In Current Mortal Form,"FOXBORO, MA—Admitting the demands of the NFL season have worn down his temporary corporeal body, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick announced Tuesday that the upcoming season would be the last he will coach in his current mortal form. “Whether we win the Lombardi trophy or not, this will be the last season I coach while shackled to this weak, decaying sack of skin and blood,” said Belichick, who claimed that he will destroy his pathetic and degrading human form only to emerge a more terrible, potent, and destructive being than any coach or player could possibly imagine. “I just don’t think I have it in me to go another season beholden to the frail, temporary form that you weaklings inhabit. This body can no longer contain my power. Soon, humanity will see the true Bill Belichick, and they will weep with joy and terror as I run rampant across the NFL.” Belichick added that the coming of his true and final form shall usher in the prophesized thousand-year reign of the golden boy over all of football."
Scouts Highly Doubtful Tim Tebow Will Ever Make It To Heaven,"NEW YORK—Despite the years of effort and success in lower-level religious practice, a group of professional scouts told reporters Friday that they strongly doubt Tim Tebow will ever make it to heaven. “I know he’s put in a lot of prayers and missionary work, but when it comes to getting to heaven, Tebow just doesn’t have the raw spirituality you need,” said scout Gregory Veitch, adding that Tebow’s lifelong commitment to finding eternal bliss in the divine Kingdom of God was impressive, but that it takes a really special kind of talent to make it all the way to the top. “I could see him spending some time in purgatory for sure—there are always open spots for someone as devoted to Christ as Tebow—but he needs to accept reality and realize that getting to heaven is just something that isn’t going to happen.” At press time, Tebow had decided to abandon Christianity and try his hand at reaching heaven through Judaism."
Carmelo Thinking He Would Be Good Fit On Team With GM Who Hasn’t Been Paying Attention Last Few Years,"NEW YORK—In an effort to make the biggest impact possible in his 17th season, Carmelo Anthony revealed Tuesday that he thinks he would be a great fit on a team with a general manager who hasn’t been paying close attention the last few years. “The ideal situation for me would be a team that thinks they need that one last piece to become a contender and a brand-new GM who’s been out of basketball for years without really keeping up,” said Anthony, explaining that he would love to find a team run by someone who is completely out of touch with advanced statistics and has spent at least half a decade or more focused on his family and personal life rather than evaluating NBA talent. “I can definitely be a major contributor on a team where upper management is in transition and completely off their game. Someplace with a GM who knows all my strengths from five years ago and a new or unpopular coach who can take all the blame for my play would be perfect.” Anthony added that his ideal teammates would be ones that didn’t need to touch the ball to have an impact."
Terry Francona Still Amazed People Think Managing Baseball Hard In Any Way,"CLEVELAND—Flatly denying that he’s had any influence whatsoever over his team’s success, Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona admitted Thursday that he was amazed people still think managing baseball was hard in any way. “If I’m being honest, there is really no strategy or skill involved at all—I could probably take a nap in the dugout and it wouldn’t make a difference,” said Francona, 59, who explained his entire plan going into every game was to have players continue to hit in their predetermined order and tell them “nice job,” when they made a good catch. “Everybody on the team already knows how baseball works, and there are only, like, four things you can do anyway. Plus, I have a bunch of assistant coaches who specialize in helping them with swings and pitching. The team could save millions if they just had an unpaid intern doing this.” Francona added that despite the ease of his job, there was a certain art to slapping players on the back."
Neil deGrasse Tyson Debunks Stadium’s Home Run Animation Depicting Ball Launching Into The Stratosphere,"NEW YORK—Slamming the pixelated video as “ludicrous” and having no basis in real-life physics, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson released a statement Wednesday debunking Yankee Stadium’s home run animation depicting a baseball being launched into Earth’s stratosphere. “First of all, absolutely no amount of human force could ever cause a baseball to exit the first layer of the atmosphere, and there is no way it would continue at steady rate, especially when you consider the gravity from the stars, moons, and comets the ball is passing; however, I’d like to clarify that those celestial objects do not exist in the stratosphere,” said Tyson, suggesting that if the animation’s intention was to demonstrate the power a batter has put into a baseball, it would be more effective to show the ball exiting the parking lot or breaking through a wooden barrier as those events are at least within the realm of possibility. “This is stupid, mindless entertainment, and I don’t know why baseball teams deceive their fans like this. A baseball would never gain enough speed during an ascent to catch on fire like that. We should all demand more scientific literacy in our jumbotron animations.” Tyson went on to clarify that while the science of the animation didn’t hold up for him, he was still able to appreciate the human drama felt by the shocked look on the baseball’s face as it hurtled towards the moon."
Royals Players Concerned About Fan Who Stuck Out 3-Hour Rain Delay,"KANSAS CITY, MO—Sadly watching from the dugout as the lone spectator refused to abandon the game, the players of the Kansas City Royals confirmed this week that they were concerned about a fan who stuck out a three-hour rain delay. “I hope he’s okay, I mean, we appreciate the support, but it’s coming down in sheets and this game has absolutely zero playoff implications,” said third-baseman Mike Moustakas, who expressed concern that the fan had seemingly nothing better to do for an entire evening than wait for a mid-season baseball game to restart while sitting through a torrential downpour. “He’s all the way up in the 400 level—he doesn’t even have good seats. I mean, it’s the middle of the week, shouldn’t he have a family or someone to go home to? Maybe we should send up a security guard to ask if he’s okay?” At press time, the fan had gotten up to leave after being unable to endure an interminably long eighth inning."
"NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL Team Owners Vote To Unionize","NEW YORK—Sending a message that they would no longer stand for dismissive treatment and inflated payrolls, owners from all four major U.S. professional sports leagues voted Wednesday to unionize. “We the owners have been exploited for too long, and with unionization, we can secure the basic rights we’ve never had as individual owners of major-market sports teams,” said Cowboys owner and union representative Jerry Jones, who issued a demand that the players immediately recognize the owners’ union and come to the table to negotiate for more fair and equitable ownership terms. “Today, we stand in solidarity with all the sports owners around the world who have been taken advantage off, forced to hand out guaranteed contracts while living without basic jet fuel reimbursements and guaranteed spa days. Separately, we’re just a bunch of millionaires and billionaires, but when we work together, we can finally wield some power.” At press time, thousands of fans took to social media to express their overwhelming support for the owners in their fight against money-grubbing athletes."
Promotion Offers Fans Free Pizza If Phillies Don't Blow Any Easy Plays In 5th Inning,"PHILADELPHIA—In an effort to boost attendance and reward fan’s patience with the young, error-prone ballclub, the Philadelphia Phillies announced a new promotion Friday offering fans free pizza if the team doesn’t blow any easy on plays while on defense in the top of the 5th inning. “We’re excited to offer our fiercely passionate fans a large one-topping pizza of their choice, provided the team can string together an inning of mistake-free baseball,” said Phillies’ Director of Public Affairs Scott Palmer, adding that fans would also receive a free order of breadsticks if two players managed to properly communicate over a fly ball without smashing into each other. “We’re already beginning to notice a new sense of excitement at the stadium, even though fans recognize how unlikely it is that we record three consecutive outs without someone bobbling a textbook grounder or overthrowing first base by a country mile.” At press time, fans were reportedly pouring out of the stadium after a passed ball triggered a huge 5th-inning rally for the division rival Marlins."
Serena Williams Stripped Of Titles After It Revealed She’s Been Playing With A Racket In Each Hand This Whole Time,"LONDON—The International Tennis Federation stripped Serena Williams of all titles, trophies, and other acclaimed achievements Tuesday after a painstaking review of her career revealed she has been playing with a tennis racket in each hand since making her professional debut. “Upon analysis of thousands of photos and hundreds of hours of video of her 39 Major title matches, it’s clear Serena has employed two rackets since her professional debut at the ’95 Bell Challenge, granting her a substantial and patently unfair competitive advantage,” said ITF president David Haggerty, acknowledging that the speed and fluidity of Williams’ swings had long confounded tournament organizers, line judges, and opponents alike. “We initially launched an investigation into the matter in 2009 after receiving several anonymous complaints, but results were inconclusive; we now suspect that Serena was holding one racket behind her back during our otherwise intensive questioning.” In a related report, Tiger Woods has been stripped of his 14 major titles after officials discovered Woods has been playing golf with two clubs in each hand."
Wimbledon Grounds Crew Frustrated After Learning About Cement Courts,"LONDON—Regretting all the time and energy they wasted caring for the grass lawn, the grounds crew at the All England Club in Wimbledon was reportedly frustrated Monday after learning about the existence of cement tennis courts. “This is painstaking work in the hot sun, trimming and watering every single day. Why didn’t someone just tell us we could pour out cement, paint on some lines, and be done with it?” asked head groundskeeper Neil Stubley, noting that to maintain perfect consistency, they had to aerate and fertilize the grass with scientific accuracy, all of which takes millions of dollars and thousands of hours of labor every year. “We’ve been doing this for decades, just assuming this was the way you had to make a tennis court, and nobody once bothered to tell us about cement. Do you know how temperamental soil is? Not to mention it gets worn down after two days of play and looks like shit. Next year, Wimbledon is going cement.” At press time, Stubley had grown even more furious after learning about the existence of indoor stadiums."
Ovechkin Hopes To Inspire Other Athletes To Power Through Month-Long Bender,"WASHINGTON—Saying the drunken exploits he managed to pull off following his first Stanley Cup victory could serve as encouragement to others, Alexander Ovechkin told reporters Tuesday he hopes to inspire athletes to successfully power through their own month-long binge-drinking sprees. “Hopefully, I can help motivate other players to keep funneling beers and pounding shots even when people start saying it’s time for them to quit—because that’s what you have to do if you want to take home that trophy one day and fill it to the brim with grain alcohol,” said the Washington Capitals forward, urging his fellow athletes to “push through” all the dry-heaving, dizziness, and headaches on the path to achieving their ultimate goal. “It’s never easy. Sometimes, you’ll be so tired you’ll want to just lie down and give up, but you have to go out there and do it again the next night, even when your body is telling you to stop. Of course, you have to train for it. No one’s tolerance starts out this high.” At press time, a bleary-eyed, barely standing Ovechkin was overheard challenging players from the Capitals’ minor-league affiliate to a game of flip cup."
Lionel Messi Pissed After Forgetting To Wear Fitbit During Last Game ,"MOSCOW—Lamenting that his fitness goals would now be thrown off for the rest of the World Cup, Argentinian forward Lionel Messi was reportedly pissed off Saturday after forgetting to wear his Fitbit watch during a group stage match against Iceland. “Shit. Of course the one time I leave it in the locker room, I go out there and run, like, 10,000 steps,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, adding that failing to log his activity stung even harder because he was merely 800 steps away from earning Fitbit’s “Ruby Slippers” badge, which he’d been attempting to earn throughout Argentina’s warm-up matches. “Ugh, now I’m going to have this weird dip in my activity, and my World Cup weight goal is totally going to be messed up. And I just know Sergio [Agüero] is going to rub it in my face—he was running like a mad man out there; there’s no way he didn’t beat my step record.” At press time, team sources confirmed Messi had since placed his Fitbit back on his wrist and was doing laps around Spartak Stadium to rack up extra miles. "
Coworker Following World Cup Goes All-In On Tenuous Family Connection To Portugal,"WILKES-BARRE, PA—Confused by his sudden, passionate rooting interest in the Mediterranean country, coworkers of area consultant Adam Shetaro told reporters Friday he was going all-in on a tenuous familial connection to Portugal for the 2018 World Cup. “I’ve worked with Adam for almost four years now, and he’s never mentioned anything about any Portuguese heritage, but ever since the World Cup started, suddenly he’s showing up to work talking about Ronaldo and decorating his cubicle with red-and-green flags,” said coworker Jason Sammak, adding that Shetaro spent his entire lunch break incessantly clapping and shouting while watching Portugal’s first-round game against Spain on the break room’s television. “I don’t know where this came from—he said something about some uncle that might have been married to a Portuguese woman, but it’s a really thin connection. And he’s really gone for it, singing some Portuguese chant when they score and defending their aggressive attack style. He even brought in these cookies he claimed were Portuguese for the game. Honestly, I’d never even heard him mention liking soccer before.” At press time, Shetaro was talking about how much he wants to travel to Portugal and see Sevilla."
"Every Bar Patron Watching World Cup Has Different, Incorrect Definition Of Offside Rule","HAWTHORNE, CA—Citing their experiences watching recent World Cups, MLS matches, and various youth soccer games, every patron at O’Brien’s Pub offered a different, incorrect definition of the sport’s notoriously nebulous “offside” ruling. “One guy’s saying that if you pass the ball across two lines, it’s offside, but his buddy is arguing that if you can get it across the center line, it’s not offside unless you then get a scoring chance. Me? I don’t know,” said bartender Casey Walker, struggling to be heard over a customer loudly and erroneously insisting that a player cannot run past a member of the opposing team at any point, even if that player is in possession of the ball. “What we all agreed sounded correct was that if a player on the attacking side enters the offensive zone before the ball, and anyone on that player’s side touches the ball before it leaves the offensive zone, that’s offside. But it turns out that’s hockey.” At press time, all the patrons had suspended arguing over the rule until they could get to the bottom of how extra time is determined."
TBS To Revive 1990s Atlanta Braves,"ATLANTA—Promising that fans would get to see all their old favorites in new and exciting situations, TBS announced plans Wednesday to revive classic 1990s baseball team the Atlanta Braves. “By bringing back the beloved Atlanta Braves of the ’90s, we hope to capture the spirit and fun of the original team but with a modern twist for a 21st-century audience,” said Turner Broadcasting president David Levy, assuring fans that the new iteration of the squad would bring back nearly all of the classic players from the first 10-season, 1,620-game run. “We are thrilled that a new generation will get to enjoy David Justice, Greg Maddux, Fred McGriff, and all the others who will be returning to the diamond on TBS. With so much talent on board, we’re confident the 2018 version of the 1990s Braves will be even better than the original.” Levy added that after gauging fan interest, they opted not to bring back any of the players from the ’90s Braves’ division rival, the New York Mets."
"Justify, Bravazo Get Into Skirmish During Belmont Stakes Weigh-In","ELMONT, NY—After weeks of trading insults and mounting animosity between the 3-year-old colts, the weigh-in for the Belmont Stakes erupted into an all-out brawl Saturday as Justify and Bravazo exchanged blows on the stage. “As soon as they hit the scales, the horses were in each others’ faces snorting, stomping, and bumping their chests, and before we knew it, the hooves were flying,” said Bravazo’s owner Brad Kelley, who ran in with several trainers and security guards to break up the fight as the horses wildly bucked and reared, knocking multiple people off stage. “There’s been bad blood between these two since the Derby when Bravazo spit in Justify’s muzzle and all hell just broke loose. It took 20 men hold them back, but not before a wild hind-leg kick from Bravazo caught a trainer in the chest and broke his sternum.” At press time, many fans criticized the weigh-in skirmishes as increasingly damaging to the reputation of horse racing, especially after the 2016 Preakness melee where four colts broke their legs and had to be shot on stage."
Cash-Strapped FiveThirtyEight Lays Off Dozens Of Top Algorithms,"NEW YORK—Explaining that downsizing was an unfortunate necessity in the challenging media landscape, FiveThirtyEight announced Friday that they would be laying off dozens of the site’s top algorithms. “While these data programs have provided readers with countless insights into sports and politics over the past few years, the challenges facing online publishers mean we must part ways with them in order to stay financially viable,” said Editor-in-Chief Nate Silver, who claimed some of the terminated algorithms’ work had been deemed redundant while other jobs like predicting NFL division winners would be folded into the workload of the presidential approval tracker. “FiveThirtyEight would not be the site it is without their thoughtful statistical outputs, but unfortunately, we can’t keep them all. The ELO rating system and generic ballot computations were such an integral part of the team, and hopefully some will be able to continue contributing as freelance algorithms.” At press time, a former FiveThirtyEight algorithm slammed the site on social media, saying it was terribly managed and predicting 1,253,788 layoffs in the near future."
Puma Researcher Has Nagging Feeling He Left Usain Bolt Running At Office,"WESTFORD, MA—Chastising himself for not double-checking everything before he left for the day, Puma researcher Benjamin Harris was reportedly overcome Friday by a nagging feeling that he had left Usain Bolt running at the office. “Goddammit, I don’t want to have to go all the way back there, but it’s really bad for his system to leave him running all night,” said a visibly conflicted Harris, noting that he remembered putting the eight-time Olympic gold medalist on the treadmill, but no matter how hard he tried, could not recall if he had stopped the Jamaican world record–holding sprinter while he was packing up to go home. “Shit, there’s no one left at work who I can call to take a look for me either. You know, everything’s probably fine, and I’m just being paranoid about the whole thing.” At press time, Harris had returned in the morning to discover that the athlete had burned out overnight and would need to be thrown away after the researcher was unable to get him to run again."
Yankees Fans Pack Stadium For Asshole Heritage Night,"NEW YORK—Selling out the entire venue and filling the standing room to capacity, thousands of fans flocked to Yankee Stadium Friday to proudly celebrate asshole heritage night. “Today, we honor the contributions and history of the many jackasses who have played for the New York Yankees as well as the pricks who cheered them on,” said legendary motherfucker Alex Rodriguez, adding that no team, not even the Boston Red Sox, could match the Yankees’ 115-year tradition of embracing and fielding total fucking bastards. “Assholes have made such a huge contribution to this franchise, from the miserable fucks who founded this team to the shitheads who currently own it. And, of course, without the millions of fuckwad fans and their asshole children, the Yankees would not be the organization they are today.” In honor of asshole heritage, Yankees merchandise stands were offering special discounts on dickhead hats and douchebag T-shirts."
Red Sox Team Doctor Unclear Whether He Supposed To Join Fight Or Not,"TAMPA BAY, FL—Watching with puzzled concern as his team ran onto the field and began shoving the opposing players, Boston Red Sox physician Adam Foster told reporters Wednesday that it was unclear if he should join a bench-clearing brawl with the Tampa Bay Rays. “I’m always happy to help the team, but I’m not sure if I’m supposed to jump in here. It just feels weird standing around while everyone is fighting 20 feet away,” said Foster, who wavered between his options while considering if he should run on the field and tackle a Tampa Bay player who was pulling Red Sox outfielder J.D. Martinez off the Ray’s third-base coach. “Maybe I could break up a fight, just so none of our guys get hurt. I should be looking out for them, right? Even the goddamn equipment manager is out there. Maybe I can just sneak up on someone and cold-cock them before anyone notices.” At press time, Foster had stepped onto the field only to be knocked out by an errant elbow from Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale."
MLB Reminds Teams To Properly Dispose Of All Torn Elbow Ligaments,"NEW YORK—Annoyed with the players’ complete lack of common courtesy, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred sternly reminded teams Friday to properly dispose of any torn elbow ligaments. “Any discarded elbow ligaments should be tied off in a plastic bag and dropped in the designated receptacles. Staff and fans shouldn’t have to worry about stepping in disgusting connective tissues just because someone didn’t feel like picking them up,” said Manfred, explaining that the head groundskeeper at Miller Park recently had been forced to clean up a whole pile of old ligaments he found rotting in the sun. “Not only is it rude, it’s unsanitary—loose ligaments and tendons spread disease while attracting vermin. If you tear an elbow ligament, it’s your responsibility to clean up after it, don’t just toss it out onto left field.” Manfred added that the Mets would be subjected to $20,000 in fines for illegally dumping a container of discarded ligaments in Long Island Sound."
"Pink Jersey Proves That Woman Is Sports Fan, Yet Also Retains A Certain Femininity","BALTIMORE—Marveling at her ability to shed so many preconceptions and societal norms, sources confirmed Tuesday that the pink Baltimore Orioles jersey worn by local 27-year-old Kelly Fournette undoubtedly shows that she is a sports fan, yet at the same time also maintains her femininity. “It is clear that this woman enjoys the sport of baseball, but the fact that her jersey is pink and not, as one would expect, orange and black, reveals that she still retains what would generally be considered traditional feminine qualities,” said onlooker Gabrielle Walters, adding that Fournette’s deft navigation around conventional gender roles was only further evidenced by the name “Mrs. Machado” emblazoned on the back of the baseball jersey above a lavender-embroidered number 13. “Here is a woman you can picture kicking back with a few beers at the game alongside several of her male friends, but just as vivid is the image of her waltzing at a gala dinner while wearing high heels and a beautiful chiffon gown. I wish I could walk such a fine line, but alas, my jersey merely features the standard home colors of the team.” Sources added that the jersey worn by Fournette’s boyfriend, which bore his own last name on the back as opposed to one of the players’, illustrates that he is a devoted sports fan who understands the importance of preserving one’s own sense of individuality."
Mark McGwire Claims He Would Have Hit 70 Home Runs Without Help Of Bat,"SAN DIEGO—Insisting that it only played a minor role in helping him break the single-season home run record, Mark McGwire claimed Wednesday that he could have hit 70 home runs even without the help of a bat. “People act like it was the only reason I was able to belt all those home runs, but deep down, I know I could have hit just as well without a bat,” said McGwire, noting that he only used a bat to keep up with all the other hitters in the 90s who were using them and that he regrets using a bat because he feels it has distracted from his natural ability as a hitter. “Using a bat doesn’t help you hit a baseball. Home runs require extraordinary hand-eye coordination, physical strength, and timing, and I had all that. A bat can’t give you the reflexes to hit a home run—bats just give you a little extra boost to emphasize the skill you already have.” McGuire also maintained that the only reason he started using bats in the first place was because of an injury during the 1990 season."
Mariners’ Staff Tired Of Ichiro Suzuki’s Long Warm-Up Routine Before Using Scanner,"SEATTLE—Groaning and rolling their eyes as the front office executive methodically stretched different muscle groups, the Mariners’ staff expressed frustration Wednesday at new coworker Ichiro Suzuki’s long warm-up routine before using the office scanner. “It’s ridiculous. He does all these breathing techniques to improve his concentration before he pulls out his damn documents,” said ticket sales rep Richard Pasch, who claimed he was forced to stand and wait for more than five minutes as Suzuki opened and closed the document cover over and over again. “He does it every time he goes up there, swinging the papers around his head and then jumping up and down, pumping his knees and tapping the email button—how is that supposed to help? I don’t care if he thinks flipping the document over exactly 100 times helps him scan, other people have work to do.” At press time, the coworkers were complaining that Suzuki’s constant stepping out of the boardroom had extended the average meeting time to over four hours."
Rockets’ Mop Guy Can Tell This Game Going To Be A Sweaty One,"HOUSTON—Assessing the perspiration dripping off the players while waiting for the next time-out, the Houston Rockets’ mop guy Kyle Collins could already tell Tuesday that Game 4 against the Utah Jazz was going to be a sweaty one. “We’re only five minutes in, [James] Harden is just drenched, and inside the paint is already slick—looks like I’m in for a big night,” said Collins while intently watching an expanding sweat mark form on Donovan Mitchell’s back and pointing out a slick spot near half court to fellow mop guy Derrick Farley. “I’ve gotta be on top of my game. We’re looking at near halftime levels of sweat out here already. Both teams are pretty moist and sticky, and Gerald [Green] looks like he fell in a lake. This is the kind of sweat you prepare for your whole career.” Collins predicted that at this rate of sweat production, he was going to go through three mop heads before the end of the game."
Derek Jeter Denies Tanking Allegations After Marlins Field 4 Players,"MIAMI—Affirming his commitment to field the best possible lineup, Miami Marlins owner and CEO Derek Jeter denied tanking allegations this week after the team fielded just four players in a loss to the Phillies. “I know people aren’t happy with our performance, but just because we didn’t have a shortstop, second baseman, third baseman, right fielder, or left fielder playing last night doesn’t mean we aren’t trying to compete every game,” said Jeter, who promised that having a one-man rotation after cutting and trading away every other pitcher on the roster gives the Marlins the best chance to win. “I expect this team to contend—I don’t care if we haven’t held a single practice or team workout in the past four months. All 16 remaining Marlins employees are working hard for the success of this franchise.” Jeter added that the recent decision to replace Don Mattingly with a dry-erase board had nothing to do with saving money."
LeBron James Credits Teammates With Providing 4 Bodies Necessary To Avoid Forfeiture Against Pacers,"CLEVELAND—Generously admitting that he most likely would not have been able to beat the gritty, defensive-minded Pacers all by himself, Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James credited his teammates during the post-game press conference Sunday with providing the necessary bodies to avoid forfeiting Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. “I really have to hand it to my guys for showing up at the arena and preventing an automatic loss with our season on the line,” said James, praising his teammates’ promptness and stressing that they were equipped to compete with warm-up sweats, jerseys, and sneakers. “We won this game today as a unit, as defined by Association regulations. I’m only one man, and whether you like it or not, that’s just not enough to field a team. Basketball really is a team sport, and you must have four other players on the court at all times.” James, visibly exhausted after averaging 41.8 points in Cavaliers’ wins during the series, also admitted that Cleveland would’ve swept Indiana if NBA rules had not mandated the presence of four superfluous players."
Joe Maddon Saves Up All His Mound Visits For One Long Trip In 8th Inning,"CHICAGO—Touting the lack of pressure to squeeze something into every second of the excursion, Cubs manager Joe Maddon confirmed Wednesday that he was saving up his mound visits for one long trip in the eighth inning. “I used to like spreading out my visits across the whole game, but then I realized it’s far more satisfying to take one long, relaxing mound trip,” said Maddon, who complained that he wasn’t able to enjoy the moment during short visits because he was constantly thinking about what he would have to do when he returned to the dugout. “Stockpiling all these outings helps me really enjoy the mound experience—you just have more time to yourself than you do during a 30-second visit. It’s nice taking a leisurely stroll and chatting with my reliever without having to worry about next innings’ matchups. In fact, I’m planning an extended two-hour visit next week.” Maddon admitted that he was sometimes forced into an unplanned mound visit to avoid losing his unused trips at the end of the month. "
White Sox Promotion Puts First 9 Fans At Ballpark In Starting Lineup,"CHICAGO—As part of an effort to boost attendance by offering a more up-close-and-personal experience, the Chicago White Sox announced a new promotion Thursday that puts the first nine fans arriving at the ballpark in the starting lineup. “Starting next week, we will bring down several lucky fans for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet their favorite players on the field and then take their place in the starting lineup for a full nine innings,” said team Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, adding that each of the fans will receive a complimentary hat, pair of cleats, and scouting reports before representing the White Sox against the best players in the Major Leagues. “Fans should try and make it as early as possible, because the very first person we see in the parking lot will be thrown onto the mound for the chance to go seven innings as our starting pitcher, while one honors student from a local school will fulfill his big-league dreams by managing the team. And don’t worry if you can’t make it this week, because this promotion will be running for every White Sox home game this season.” Reinsdorf added that a few people would enjoy the unforgettable memories of representing the White Sox while also providing a much better experience for fans watching in the stands."
Don Mattingly Yelling At Marlins For Leaving Dome Open With AC On,"MIAMI—Unleashing a furious tirade after finding the roof retracted for the third time this month, Miami Marlins manager Don Mattingly admonished his players Monday for leaving the dome open with the stadium’s air conditioning running. “Come on, guys, this is just wasteful. I’ve told you a hundred times, either leave the dome closed or turn off the AC,” said Mattingly, who angrily led the team over to the temperature and dome retraction controls, pointing out that they were right by the locker room and adding that there was “no damn excuse” for acting so irresponsibly. “Every time you do this, it costs the team $150,000—that money is going right out of the dome. We aren’t paying to cool down the entire city, okay guys? And if I catch one more person trying to lower the temperature past 72, I’m taking the next electric bill out of their paycheck.” At press time, Mattingly was asking the team why the entire stadium’s lights were on even though they were only using the weight room."
Patriots Claim Unsanctioned Recording Was Only For Project Julian Edelman Working On For Filmmaking Class,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Defending the video as absolutely necessary for the wide receiver to secure at least a ‘B’ from Massasoit Community College, Patriots officials claimed Friday that their unsanctioned recording of the Bengals sideline last week was only for a project Julian Edelman was working on for a film class. “Julian has just gotten really into cinema the last few years, and he’s trying to branch out from football with some experimental films,” said owner Robert Kraft, who dismissed accusations that the Patriots were trying to steal signals for their upcoming game by explaining that Edelman wanted the cameras hidden in the stands to mimic the zoomed-out, wide-angle shots used by some of his biggest directorial influences. “It’s been so great to see Julian come alive while taking this class, and it upsets me seeing the media and other NFL teams using this as a flimsy pretense to accuse us of cheating. We’re just trying to enrich the lives of our players by letting them grow as people off the field, and Julian thought covertly filming the Cincinnati sidelines was a great idea for a short film. His professor apparently thinks he has real talent and told him he should submit his stuff to some local film festivals.” At press time, the NFL had dismissed all charges against the Patriots after Kraft donated $10 million towards the creation of an NFL film scholarship program for the league’s players."
Jerry Jones Hoping To Use 2018 Draft To Find Long-Term Solution At Mistress,"DALLAS—Revealing that the Cowboys owner was looking for stability at an essential position, team sources confirmed Thursday that Jerry Jones is planning to use the 2018 NFL Draft to find a long-term solution at mistress. “This isn’t about a short-term fix. There is going to be a lot of talent at the draft, but I need to find a top-level mistress who can deliver for the next 10 years or more,” said Jones, who noted that he had personally traveled down to LSU and Florida to scout a possible paramour before deciding to use the “absolutely stacked” lineup at the NFL draft to shore up his open mistress spot. “We’ve had too much instability with my mistresses recently, and we need to be thinking about the future of the franchise. She’s going to need not only the looks and skill, but the temperament and toughness to last in this demanding role—not everyone can handle the spotlight of being a Dallas Cowboys mistress.” Jones added that if he can’t find a permanent solution at the draft, he might opt for a three-woman mistress-by-committee approach."
Bears GM Wavering Between Drafting Good Player Or Bad Player,"CHICAGO—Admitting that he was torn over which one would be the best fit for the roster, Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Pace told reporters Thursday that he was wavering between drafting a good player or a bad player. “It’s a real toss-up because on one hand, you have a guy with tremendous instincts and athleticism, but on the other, you have an inconsistent, injury-prone question mark from a third-rate program. How do you make that choice?” said Pace, adding that it was almost impossible to weigh the advantages of drafting a perennial Pro Bowler to build the team around against the potential upside of a guaranteed bust. “The whole staff has been going back and forth between grabbing a prospect who’s good at football or drafting the one who can’t play for shit. One has world-class speed, the other is slow. One is a natural leader, the other is a known locker-room cancer. These are the tough decisions that keep you up at night as a GM.” At press time, Pace was considering a third option of getting fleeced with a draft-day trade."
Tom Brady Reveals That Humanity Will Perish Long Before He Retires,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Assuring fans and reporters that his football career was far from over, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady revealed Wednesday that humanity would perish long before he retires. “You can’t take anything for granted in the NFL, but I’m taking care of my body, and I plan to keep playing football for at least a few more years after all human civilization lies in ruins,” said Brady, adding that New England fans can expect him to appear on the field every Sunday until long after all traces of mankind’s accomplishments have faded to dust. “Football is my life, and I’ve been eating clean to make sure I can play at the highest level well into the next geologic era. I know I’m 40 years old, and people are talking about my successor, but I promise that your cities will be overgrown graveyards for countless millennia before I hang up my cleats.” Brady did admit that he was concerned about his throwing shoulder holding up against the pressure of the universe’s eventual heat death."
Kobe Bryant Hits Editing Bay To Train In Defense Of This Year’s Oscar Win,"LOS ANGELES—Dedicating himself to improving his skills every day in search of a repeat victory in the Best Animated Short category, Kobe Bryant reportedly hit the video editing bay Tuesday to work on defending his Academy Award win for Dear Basketball. “I’m trying to stay on top of my game, so I start every day at 6 a.m. and just lock myself in the film room,” said Bryant, explaining that getting older has forced him to rely less on driving all-day shoots and more on perfect cuts and precise transitions. “A lot of guys think winning an Oscar is all about directing and flashy shots, but spending hours studying tape in the editing bay is just as important—that’s how you contend for a trophy year after year. Some people are satisfied winning once, but I won’t be satisfied until I’ve won five or six more Academy Awards.” At press time, Bryant was threatening to move to another production studio if ownership didn’t meet his demands for a new assistant director."
"Michael Jordan Attacks Softness, Lack Of Competitiveness In Modern Blackjack Players","LAS VEGAS—Guaranteeing they couldn’t “hack it” back in the ’80s and ’90s, former NBA star Michael Jordan spoke out Tuesday blasting the weakness and lack of drive in modern blackjack players. “These soft and coddled blackjack players today, who come into the Bellagio and stand on a jack and a five, they could never compete with the guys I went up against every single night,” said Jordan, complaining that today’s competitors lacked the killer instinct necessary to thrive in the clutch and single-handedly take over a card game when they were down by 20 or 30 grand. “Blackjack used to be about toughness. There was one night I busted out on 20 straight hands, but I kept grinding. These young players just expect to be handed a 21, they don’t want to fight for it. Back in the day, I knew hardcore guys who would hit on 17 all the time—they had grit and just wanted to dominate.” Jordan added that despite being 55 years old, he was confident that he could take any blackjack player in the world one-on-one."
Report: PyeongChang Olympic Athletes Already Falling Into State Of Disrepair,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA—Decrying the rapid decay of what were planned to be pillars of the local community, PyeongChang officials confirmed Wednesday that only weeks after the Olympics, many of their athletes were already completely dilapidated. “The Olympics were supposed to be about building the future of South Korea, and yet many of these athletes are filthy, untended, and falling to pieces,” said Governor Choi Moon-soon, displaying pictures of the crumbling skiers and ice dancers who, recently pristine, have already been abandoned and left to rot. “The money we put into these state-of-the-art athletes could have gone to so many other things, but instead, we have a hockey team that nobody will ever see again and a bunch of broken-down bobsledders. This was a massive, multi-billion dollar investment in something that only mattered for a few weeks, and now neighborhoods are covered in debris from neglected Olympians.” Officials added that if something was not done to rescue these derelict athletes soon, they would have to be demolished."
Annoyed Shohei Ohtani Had Hoped U.S. Baseball Players Wouldn’t Be This Bad,"ANAHEIM, CA—Frustrated with the level of play he has encountered during his first week of competition in the American major leagues, Japanese baseball phenom Shohei Ohtani told reporters Monday that he’d hoped American players wouldn’t be this bad. “When I decided to leave Japan to sign with the [Los Angeles] Angels, I thought I’d have to push myself to compete at the next level, but this has all been way too easy,” said the 23-year-old after a dominant performance on the mound and the batter’s box, adding that his new peers were hardly a step up from the lowly Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. “At first, I thought the guys were just messing with me, but when I homered three times in three days and took a perfect game into the seventh inning the day after that, well...Turns out I’m just better than everyone else. This honestly wasn’t even worth the money.” Reporters confirmed Ohtani seemed bored and listless throughout the interview, answering questions while tossing 94 mile-per-hour warm-up pitches in the bullpen with his off hand."
PGA Officials Break Up Crowd Of Rowdy Fans Committing Commodities Fraud In Augusta National Parking Lot,"AUGUSTA, GA—Noting that the out-of-control individuals harassed numerous female attendees and sent the world price of eggs and pork into a free fall, PGA officials reportedly had to break up a crowd of rowdy fans who were committing commodities fraud Friday in the Augusta National’s parking lot. “We’ve received multiple complaints from visitors about a group of loud fans dressed in designer suits who were throwing beer cans and shouting into their phones to manipulate the soybean futures market,” said Masters head of security Peter Novello, who claimed that when approached by officials, the intoxicated men quickly scattered, leaving behind half-empty bottles of Macallan scotch and reams of overseas bank account information. “These individuals were belligerent, screaming obscenities at bystanders and demanding they invest their life savings in dummy corporations. We had to eject several fans who were gathered in a circle behind the clubhouse, getting in fist fights and throwing down their clients’ entire portfolio on roll-of-the-dice tech investments.” PGA sources confirmed that despite dispersing the group as quickly as possible, the rowdy fans had already managed to cause $5,000 in property damage and had defrauded investors for more than $27 million."
Kobe Bryant Creates Foundation To Help Children Struggling With Severe Narcissism,"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to destigmatize the condition of those who live with pathological self-centeredness, former basketball great Kobe Bryant held a press conference Friday to announce the launch a new foundation to help children struggling with severe narcissism. “I’ve dealt with this condition my whole life, so I feel a personal responsibility to help these kids who suffer from extreme selfishness,” said the five-time NBA champion, adding that children born without empathy should never feel ashamed, but encouraged to embrace their egotistical nature. “So many kids have to deal with grandiose views of their own talents, yet they don’t have anyone guiding them. I wish I’d had this kind of help back in high school when I was craving attention and screaming at my teammates. I’m just glad I can use my platform to teach young people that they deserve preferential treatment and constant, unwavering admiration.” Bryant added that while starting the foundation had been an amazing experience, it would have been a lot easier if the people working for him could actually follow orders and learn to do their jobs right."
Yankees Eliminate Longstanding ‘No Pubic Hair’ Policy,"NEW YORK—After years of complaints from players and fans over the outmoded mandate, the New York Yankees announced Wednesday they would eliminate the organization’s longstanding “no pubic hair” policy. “Effective this season, we are removing most of the restrictions on members of the New York Yankees growing their pubic hair,” said co-chairman Hal Steinbrenner, who admitted that while the rule had been an important part of Yankee culture since the 1960s, ownership felt it was no longer necessary or in keeping with modern society’s more relaxed attitude towards pubic hair. “When this policy was enacted, pubic hair was considered sloppy and unprofessional, but we recognize that times have changed. We will still maintain some strict rules about the length and styling, but as long as it’s clean and trim, players are now free to do as they want with their pubic hair.” Steinbrenner went on to deny any claims that the pubic hair policy was abolished to lure Bryce Harper next offseason."
A’s Unveil Groundbreaking New Tarp Renovation For Oakland Coliseum,"OAKLAND, CA—Describing the massive, water-resistant sheet as a “major step forward” in the stadium’s rain deferral technology, the Oakland Athletics unveiled a groundbreaking new tarp renovation Thursday for the Oakland Coliseum. “This state-of-the-art tarp is going to bring the A’s ground maintenance capabilities into the 21st century,” said owner John J. Fisher, explaining that the tarp, made from an innovative high-tensile woven polyester fabric, was the biggest renovation the team has undertaken in three decades and will replace the outdated tarp that the stadium had used since 1972. “We are committed to giving the A’s fans the best experience possible, and this tarp is tougher and more waterproof than anything available—there is no other tarp like it in Major League Baseball. We think fans are really going to love the reduced moisture content of the infield, and we hope that this new tarp will make the Oakland As much more competitive at drawing in top-name groundskeepers.” Fisher also revealed the new tarp is just the first phase of a larger stadium renovation plan that would see the bathroom floors of the main concourse completely re-spackled by 2022."
MLB Season Ends Over 200 Days Early After New Rules Speed Up Games Way Too Much,"NEW YORK—With players, coaches, and executives around the league admitting that the sudden finish had taken them completely by surprise, sources confirmed that the Major League Baseball season ended Thursday night over 200 days earlier than expected after new rules designed to make games take less time sped them up way too much. “We were anticipating that our new guidelines would reduce the amount of time in a nine-inning game, but we absolutely weren’t expecting that the average game would take only one minute and three seconds to play,” said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, adding that rules designed to limit mound visits and cut down on commercial breaks ended up accelerating game times to such a degree that the first half of the season wrapped up at around 4:48 p.m. yesterday afternoon. “We definitely did see the games go much faster than last year, especially during the three-hour second half of the season. But then after the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Houston Astros 7-6 in a thrilling four-minute, 12-inning game to clinch the World Series title in six, we realized the season was over. The league would like to congratulate Mike Trout on his MVP-winning Triple Crown season, as well as the Brewers’ Chase Anderson on his surprise Cy Young campaign. We’ll see you all in 2019, I guess.” Sources confirmed that among those disappointed by the results of the season were the New York Yankees, who barely finished above .500 after slugger Giancarlo Stanton missed over 70 games while he was in the bathroom."
NFL Sues EA To End Production Of Unlicensed ‘Madden’ Video Games,"NEW YORK—Claiming the video game company’s unauthorized, decades-long use of their brand and intellectual property has resulted in financial losses running into the hundreds of millions, the National Football League sued Electronic Arts Tuesday to stop the production, sale, and distribution of its unlicensed “Madden NFL” series. “Despite our numerous written pleas to cease and desist in their wholesale use of the NFL’s trademarked personalities, iconography, and statistical database, EA Sports has continued to brazenly profit from the NFL brand and leaves us no choice but to take legal action,” said league general counsel Jeff Pash, detailing the company’s unauthorized use of the NFL logo dating back to 1994. “We don’t intend to be predatory with this lawsuit—If Electronic Arts had merely shown a real player here or there we’d probably look the other way. However, considerable effort has been expended on their part to accurately reproduce every team in its entirety, as well as update all the rosters, jerseys, logos, and stadiums each year to reflect any changes. This is not simply a football game—It’s a pure example of large-scale theft.” The NFL has been joined in its lawsuit by former coach and broadcaster John Madden, who discovered last month that EA had been using both his name and colorfully random commentary in their football video games for years without his knowledge."
Gregg Popovich Berates Spurs For Missing Nation’s Descent Into Oligarchy ,"SAN ANTONIO—Seething after watching his players allow the wealthy to control the legislative process totally unopposed, head coach Gregg Popovich reportedly blasted the Spurs Wednesday for completely missing America’s descent into an oligarchy. “Wake up out there guys, how many times do I have to point out that trickle-down economics does nothing but consolidate wealth into the hands of the elite?” said Popovich, who furiously scrawled out a chart on his whiteboard that illustrated stagnant worker wage growth skyrocketing executive salaries. “You guys are running around like you can’t see cutting corporate taxes does nothing but increase the deficit and aid entrenched powers. Ginobili, Gasol, we’ve gone over Citizens United in practice for weeks. Didn’t we study all that video on how the middle class is being gutted? How are you not seeing this?” At press time, Popovich was admonishing the team for not spotting their own complicity in the unequal system while they ran back on defense."
Minneapolis Shocked To Discover Thousands Of Super Bowl Attendees Left Without Seeing Rest Of City,"MINNEAPOLIS— Perplexed by the utter absence of thronging tourists throughout places of interest, Minneapolis residents reported feelings of shock and dismay Monday upon discovering that thousands of Super Bowl attendees had simply left the Twin Cities immediately after the game without experiencing the rich culture the area has to offer. “My colleagues tell me there are no crowds whatsoever at the American Swedish Institute, local merchants say attendance is actually down at the Mall of America, and the parks department is confounded that few if any people have toured our many impressive local bodies of water,” said Minneapolis Sculpture Garden curator Lukas Svensson, who was forced to send most of his staff home Monday afternoon when droves of awestruck visitors from across the nation inexplicably failed to appear. “I personally can’t understand why no one wants to see our sculpture of a big spoon with a cherry perched jauntily on top, unless the 8-degree weather has something to do with it.” Civic leaders were reportedly not surprised whatsoever upon being told that the situation was identical in St. Paul, which they described as “a frozen, passive-aggressive suburb of Minneapolis made up of alternating churches and bars.”"
Flustered Father Struggling To Answer All Of Son’s Questions About What Catch Is,"ALBANY, NY—Feeling completely unprepared for such a difficult conversation, local father Michael Dorgan was reportedly struggling Monday to answer all his son’s questions about what a catch is. “God, this so awkward, he was watching the Super Bowl last night, and now he has so many questions and I can’t describe how it works,” said Dorgan, who admitted to stammering his way through an uncomfortable 10-minute explanation of what a football move is. “I tried bringing out a football to show him what maintaining possession means, but I think it just confused him more. And there was this painful silence after he asked about controlling the ball long enough to become a runner. How do you explain something as complicated and mysterious as that to your son? I wish he just asked his mother.” Dorgan added that something as important and complicated as what a catch is should definitely be taught in school."
2018 Winter Olympics Cancelled Due To Inclement Weather,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA—Citing safety concerns for both competitors and spectators, representatives from the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday that the 2018 Winter Olympics have been cancelled due to weather conditions being far too cold. “Because of a combination of subfreezing temperatures and the fact that many of the event spaces are now covered in snow and ice, this year’s Winter Games have unfortunately been called off,” said IOC President Thomas Bach, noting that it would be irresponsible to expose athletes to an increased risk of slipping and falling in the frozen conditions, especially in already dangerous sports such as downhill skiing and figure skating. “We even considered having participants wear bulky protective coats, gloves, and hats, but ultimately realized this would have a negative effect on both performance and viewing enjoyment. We extend our sincerest apologies to all those who were excited to watch and participate in the events, but it has become clear that it is simply too cold to move forward.” At press time, the IOC has tentatively rescheduled the Winter Games for June of 2022."
Nation Praying For Super Nasty Luge Accident,"WASHINGTON—Expressing a deep desire to see an unbelievably gut-wrenching and epic crash, Americans across the country were reportedly praying Monday for a super nasty luge accident. “I’m just hoping we get a chance to watch a guy lose control of the sled, slam really hard into the wall, and then go tumbling down the ice track head over heels like a fucking rag doll,” said Dayton, OH resident Peter Murphy, echoing the sentiment of 323 million Americans who were wishing for the opportunity to witness a luge competitor wildly careen sideways down the incline, fall off the sled, and painfully roll down the course until their immobile body glides across the finish line. “God, please just let me see someone fly up high into the air over the side of the track and then plunge face-first into a snowbank. I promise I’ll try to be a good person from now on. I just want to watch one crazy-ass crash at 80 miles per hour where the guy breaks all his limbs and the stunned announcers go silent while the EMTs rush to help.” The nation added that they would also consider settling for a gruesome-as-hell bobsledding wreck."
"‘Well That’s Nice,’ Say Calm, Pleased Eagles Fans After Super Bowl Victory","PHILADELPHIA—Happily nodding their heads and shaking hands with each other in congratulations, thousands of pleased but calm Philadelphia residents reportedly said, “Well that’s nice,” Sunday after the Eagles’ Super Bowl victory over the Patriots. “This sure is swell. Both teams played a good game, but I’m glad we came out on top,” said local Eagles fan Jeremy Romano, who smiled and quietly began cleaning up beer cans and pizza boxes as his contented party guests quietly patted each other on the back while watching the Eagles receive the Lombardi Trophy. “Boy, it sure is nice to finally see the Eagles win the Super Bowl. The Patriots can hold their heads high, though, they really gave it their all. What a pleasant evening.” At press time, sources confirmed that a group of celebrating Philadelphia fans on the street had grabbed dozens of empty beer bottles and placed them in the appropriate recycling bin."
Report: 78% Of Puppy Bowl Participants Die Before Reaching 50 Weeks,"BIRMINGHAM, AL—Blaming the punishing physical toll the game takes on their bodies, an alarming report released Sunday by the National Center for Sports Safety revealed that 78 percent of Puppy Bowl participants die before reaching the age of 50 weeks. “Our data confirmed pugs, cocker spaniels, and huskies that participate in the Puppy Bowl rarely live to see 50 weeks,” said lead researcher James Henderson, noting that after 35 weeks, many former Puppy Bowl competitors no longer recognize the people rubbing their bellies, and simple acts like standing on their hind legs can cause excruciating pain. “Because these young canines are exposed to such brutal hits, by the end of their lives, most Puppy Bowl players can barely roll over, let alone chase around a sock. Many are in agony even when they are just gnawing on a squeaky toy. It’s devastating for families to watch former stars like Beebop and Wilma pass away in what should be their prime.” At press time, Puppy Bowl officials were denying any attempts to bury a previous study about the connection between hits on defenseless retrievers and peeing on the carpet."
Eagles Fan Admits U.S. Bank Stadium Has Nicest Seats He’s Puked On,"MINNEAPOLIS—Claiming the quality of the facilities had exceeded his expectations, Eagles fan Wes Fernley admitted Sunday that U.S. Bank Stadium had the nicest seats he has ever thrown up on. “I’ve been to some great stadiums in the past few years, but puking here was a really amazing experience,” said Fernley, who praised the venue’s large, well-placed LED screens that made it easy to follow to the action while doubled over vomiting from any direction. “I thought the new Giants’ stadium was a pretty nice place to hurl, but I’ve never barfed all over cleaner, more modern bathrooms. Plus, there are tons of amazing bars and restaurants to pass out in. Viking fans are so lucky they get to puke here every home game.” At press time, Fernley was praising the convenience of using the stadium’s app to find a great hoagie that he could retch after the game."
Cleveland Indians Owner Admits Chief Wahoo No Longer Compatible With Modern Revenue Growth Expectations,"CLEVELAND—Stressing the importance of showing consideration for every stockholder, Cleveland Indians owner Paul Dolan admitted Monday that mascot Chief Wahoo is no longer compatible with modern revenue growth expectations. “Although he has been the franchise symbol for decades, we decided it’s best to remove Chief Wahoo out of a deep respect for our bottom line,” said Dolan, who revealed that organizational leaders worked for months to devise a plan that balanced the interests of fans and those who have real concerns over what profit margins are appropriate in this day and age. “Chief Wahoo was from a different era, and society has moved beyond the cash flow projections we used to be okay with in the past. I know many people in Cleveland have a long connection to the Chief, but he is just not a mascot for 21st century earnings.” Dolan added that some Chief Wahoo merchandise would still be available for sale out of reverence for his former profitability with fans."
"Fired-Up Patriots Ready To Give Full 60, Maybe 70% Against Jacksonville","FOXBOROUGH, MA—Assuring that the team knew exactly what it would take to win, fired-up Patriots players told reporters Sunday they were ready to give a full 60, maybe 70 percent against Jacksonville. “We are pumped for this showdown, and the Jags are going to see two-thirds, maybe three-fourths of our best—if the game seems close,” said Rob Gronkowski, who revealed the Patriots have been going pretty decently hard in practice all week while devoting whole minutes to watching game tape on the Jaguars defense. “It’s going to take nothing less than perfectly average execution to prevail today. Coach [Belichick] got us jacked up when he told us that if want to get past Jacksonville, he was going to need our B, or possibly B-minus game.” Gronkowski added that he wouldn’t be happy with his performance today unless he left about half of what he has out on the field."
New NFL Safety Rule Requires Players To Be Careful ,"NEW YORK—In an effort to minimize the risk of traumatic brain injury, a new NFL safety rule going into effect Friday will require all players to be careful. “As part of the NFL’s ongoing effort to ensure players are as safe as possible, they will now all be obligated to watch it out there,” said NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, adding that players not taking it easy would be subject to a fine as well as a mandatory four-game suspension. “Football can be a little physical sometimes, so we want all players to just exercise some caution when blocking, tackling, or doing pretty much anything on the field. When it comes to safety, we’re really all on the same team.” At press time, the number of players suffering from concussions had dropped to nearly zero."
NFL Revokes Roger Goodell’s New Contract After He Fails Physical,"NEW YORK—In a stunning development after the league’s decision to grant a 5-year extension to the commissioner, the NFL revoked Roger Goodell’s new contract Thursday after he failed his physical. “Unfortunately, the $200 million deal we were prepared to offer Roger was conditional upon his ability to complete our fitness exam,” said spokesman Joe Lockhart, explaining that Goodell’s contract was terminated after the medical evaluation revealed several issues that might impair the 59-year-old’s capacity to discipline individuals, fine players, or strip draft picks from teams for misconduct. “Frankly, we were left with no choice after Mr. Goodell arrived to the exam 38 pounds overweight and failed to disclose a number of health issues to us. We’re sad to see Roger go and wish the best to him and his family.” Lockhart added that he hopes Goodell finds the help he needs after disclosing that the physical revealed the commissioner had been running the league with an undisclosed concussion. "
Ohio State Self-Reported Secondary Violations They Just Assume Currently Happening,"COLUMBUS, OH—Admitting guilt for infractions that sound like the types of obscure recruiting rules the school would break, Ohio State’s athletic director self-reported to the NCAA several secondary violations he just assumed were currently happening. “I don’t have concrete evidence that these things are going on, but I figured at least a handful of these rules are being broken given our track record,” said athletic director Gene Smith, who said he could not point to specific examples of wrongdoing, but assured reporters that at the very least he assumes his coaches are currently texting people they shouldn’t. “More likely than not, we’re also probably having former players in the NFL contact our kids because that just feels like stuff we like to do. I’m pretty comfortable filling out the paperwork to let the NCAA know something wrong is probably going on somewhere.” At press time, the NCAA had released a statement saying they assumed they were already closely monitoring the university for some recruiting bullshit."
"‘Football Saved My Life,’ Says Man Who Will Be Left Paralyzed By Sport","FAYETTEVILLE, AR—Claiming that his participation in the sport steered him away from the poor choices he had been making as a child, local junior college linebacker Steven Colner, who will be left paralyzed by the sport in a year, told reporters Thursday that football “saved [his] life.” “Football made me the person I am today, and I’m so grateful for that,” said the man who next summer will be rendered incapable of movement from the waist down by a routine tackle during summer training camp. “My coaches put me on the right path, and it gave me an alternative to so many of the bad choices my friends were making. I don’t want to think what my life would’ve been like without it.” The man who will soon be confined to a wheelchair then told reporters he cannot wait to teach the sport to his future children."
Browns Encourage Dissatisfied Fans To At Least Stick It Out Until End Of Season ,"CLEVELAND—Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam urged unhappy fans Tuesday to continue to support the team through at least the end of the season. “I know this has been unenjoyable, but back in the summer you guys made a commitment,” said Haslam, adding that if Browns fans really wanted to give up after the season was finally over that was a choice he could at least respect. “You’ve already stuck with it for this long, so with only a couple games left, why not just gut it out? I mean, come on, you think you’re the only ones who’ve thought about quitting?” Haslam then added to reporters that if fans were going to just half-ass it the rest of the way, he’d rather they just quit and get the fuck out of his sight."
Witnesses To Gordon Hayward Injury Continuing Long Road To Recovery,"BOSTON, MA—Witnesses to Gordon Hayward’s gruesome injury are slowly continuing their long road to recovery, sources confirmed Tuesday. “After seeing an injury like that, we thought a lot of these people would never be able to watch basketball again,” said sports therapist Richard O’Malley, citing the severe damage to the psyches of those who cringed at the sight of Gordon’s broken leg. “We don’t want to rush them back too quickly or before they’re ready, because there’s nothing worse than watching the game of basketball scared. But they’re progressing nicely, and by this time next year they may very well be suiting up in their Kevin McHale jerseys ready to watch a full 48 minutes.” O’Malley added that it is possible those who saw the broken leg may actually return to the game mentally stronger as a result of their rehabilitation."
New Report Finds Giants Just 5 Years Away From Acquiring Offensive Weapons,"NEW YORK—Warning that they should no longer be viewed as a meek and harmless franchise, sources confirmed Monday that the New York Giants are likely to acquire powerful offensive weapons within the next five years. “The Giants may seem insignificant now, but if they are allowed to go unchecked, they could become one of the most dangerous teams in the league by 2022,” said NFL scout Todd Sandberg, adding the mounting evidence suggests the Giants have the technical skills and sources to eventually develop an explosive running back and could one day become a multi-dimensional threat. “They’re weak now, but ambitious, and we have every reason to believe they will not stop until taken seriously. Nobody really knows what they’re thinking and that is dangerous.” Sandberg emphasized that the quest to acquire offensive weapons could be accelerated by the team’s impending regime change."
Giants Players Beg Al Michaels Not To Use Their Real Names During Starting Lineup Introduction,"WASHINGTON—Desperately hoping to avoid humiliation on the national stage, sources confirmed that members of the New York Giants pleaded with NBC play-by-play sportscaster Al Michaels to avoid using their real names during the starting lineup introductions of Thursday night’s broadcast. “Please do me a solid and say my name is Jerry or Tim or something,” said running back Paul Perkins, noting that he had hoped to avoid humiliating his family members and friends who would likely be watching the Thanksgiving Day game. “I can’t have my family name associated with this. It would crush my mother, so please just either make up a name or say mine super fast. I’ll owe you one.” At press time, Eli Manning was reportedly asking NBC producers to also blur the image of him used in the lineup graphics."
Assistant Coach Finally Works Up Courage To Blow Whistle,"OKLAHOMA CITY—Saying they were caught completely off guard by his sudden act of assertiveness, onlookers at a Duncan High School varsity football practice reported Wednesday that second-year assistant coach Bill Vining had finally worked up the courage to blow his whistle. “Everyone just froze and we thought we were in big trouble or something,” sophomore cornerback Matt Baker told reporters, noting that the soft-spoken coach had rarely ever addressed more than a handful of players at once, let alone the entire team. “Even [head] coach [Charles] Pettis looked puzzled when he saw who blew the whistle. Once he had total silence and the undivided attention of every player, coach, and student on the field, he told us we had a big game this week and we needed to have a good practice today. It was really strange.” Players and coaches later confirmed to reporters that Vining ended the practice by offering to walk the offense through a new play he had drawn up."
Giants Excited About Seeing Real NFL End Zone Up Close,"DENVER—Excitedly running their hands along the white goal line and huddling around the pylons, members of the New York Giants were thrilled to see a real NFL end zone up close before their game against the Denver Broncos, sources confirmed Sunday. “Oh my God, hey, Eli [Manning], come over here and check this out!” said running back Paul Perkins, who reportedly posed for photos in the end zone with his teammates before asking a referee if they were allowed to share them on social media. “Wow, I’ve heard friends on the Jaguars and Browns talk about seeing an end zone, but that’s just not the same as seeing one for yourself. This is amazing. I still can’t believe my eyes.” At press time, coach Ben McAdoo was reportedly scrambling to control the chaos after Jason Pierre-Paul spread a rumor among the defense that they might see the opposing team’s backfield that day."
NFL Announces Plans To Stream ‘Thursday Night Football’ Exclusively On Delta Flights,"NEW YORK—In an effort to continue delivering games to viewers in new and innovative ways, the NFL announced plans Wednesday to begin streaming “Thursday Night Football” exclusively on Delta flights. “We are thrilled that NFL fans will now be able to enjoy the excitement of ‘Thursday Night Football’ exclusively through Delta’s in-flight streaming services,” said NFL spokesperson Joe Willard, adding that access to every Thursday game can be purchased for a small fee of $2.99 per hour, and will be available on all of Delta’s domestic and international aircraft. “Delta Studios is an industry-leading platform that reaches football fans across the country, and the seat-back screen is a perfect broadcast medium for the NFL. All any fan needs to do is buy a domestic flight ticket, board the plane, swipe their credit card, and then sit back and enjoy that’s week’s Thursday night matchup.” Willard added that “Thursday Night Football” streaming would be blacked out on any flights with fewer than 40 viewers."
Tom Brady Admits To Playing With Matt Ryan’s Chip On Shoulder,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Explaining that he draws inspiration from the Atlanta Falcons signal caller, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady told reporters Tuesday that he continues to play the game with Matt Ryan’s chip on his shoulder. “When I hear people say Matt isn’t a proven winner and that he collapses in big moments, it just makes me want to work that much harder,” Brady told reporters, adding that the doubters who say Ryan is just another modern quarterback with gaudy numbers and no championships are what motivate him to show up to the practice field first and leave last. “I hear all the sports-talk pundits and newspaper headlines criticizing Matt every time I work out, and those are the things that keep me going when I’m feeling tired or want to quit. In a way, I’m almost thankful for all the people who say Matt can’t be the best.” Brady went on to add that whenever he needs a little extra motivational boost, he recalls how Ryan probably felt after blowing a 25-point lead in Super Bowl LI to the Patriots."
Stadium Crowd Unsure When It Okay To Sit After Honoring WWII Veteran,"BUFFALO, NY—Fearful of disrespecting the 91-year-old former naval aviator, the crowd at Ralph Wilson Stadium was reportedly unsure when it was okay to sit after honoring a WWII veteran before Sunday’s Bills game. “The speech is over and the applause are dying down, but he’s still hanging around out there,” said spectator Josh Bray, 27, echoing the sentiments of the roughly 60,000 fans struggling to determine if the man being recognized for his service in the Battle of Midway had stopped waving because the ceremony was over or simply because he was tired. “I think he’s starting to head off the field, so I guess I’m going to sit.” At press time, the seated crowd quickly panicked after the smiling, waving veteran was put back up on the jumbotron after reaching the sideline."
Doctors Warn Marshawn Lynch That Next Time He Goes Into Beast Mode Could Kill Him,"OAKLAND, CA—Calmly reiterating to the incredulous Oakland Raiders running back that they were looking out for his best interests, doctors warned Marshawn Lynch Wednesday that the next time he goes into Beast Mode could kill him. “Marshawn, I know you’ve gone through most of your Beast Modes without incident, but now that you’re on the wrong side of 30, your body is screaming for you to stop,” said Raiders team doctor Warren King before attempting to comfort Lynch after the running back broke down into tears while assuring doctors he felt perfectly fine going into Beast Mode. “I know it may seem drastic, but every time you go into Beast Mode, you bring yourself one step closer to paralysis or even death. Marshawn, is Beast Mode really worth that much to you?” At press time, Lynch’s family and friends reportedly began organizing efforts to show the depressed running back that he can live a full life after Beast Mode."
Russell Westbrook Briefly Forgets How To Dribble After Thinking About It Too Hard,"SACRAMENTO, CA—Freezing in a moment of complete panic after receiving an inbounds pass during a game against the Sacramento Kings, Oklahoma City Thunder shooting guard Russell Westbrook told reporters Tuesday night that he briefly forgot how to dribble after thinking about it too hard. “I just really got in my own head and started second-guessing how I’m supposed to bounce the ball off the ground and back into my hand again,” said Westbrook, who admitted that he briefly even considered bending over and firmly pushing the ball into the ground with both hands. “When I realized just how automatic I’d been whenever I dribbled before, I just got freaked out even more. I’ve done it thousands of times, but the more I thought about how to dribble, the worse it got.” Westbrook then added that he hoped to avoid being asked to dribble anytime in the near future."
Chase Utley Freaks Out Dodgers With Spooky Story Of Home Run Ball That Was Never Found,"LOS ANGELES—Quietly revealing that it had happened on a similar cloudy fall night, Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley reportedly freaked out his teammates before Game 3 of the World Series Friday evening with a spooky story of a home run ball that was never found. “Listen, all, to this old tale of a home run ball that was hit out of the park and never, ever heard from again,” said Utley, holding a flashlight under his face as his teammates slowly gathered around him, huddling under blankets in the dark, silent Dodger Stadium dugout. “Some say it comes in the night for overly aggressive batters who chase pitches outside the strike zone, others say it still haunts the upper mezzanine to this day. If you go up there on a quiet night, you might hear the sound of it slowly rolling in search of a fan to finally catch it.” At press time, the entire team had reportedly gasped and gone silent at the sound of something rolling across the dugout roof."
Rams Simulate Playing Giants by Pumping Crowd Groans Into Speakers,"LOS ANGELES—Stressing the importance of practicing in the same conditions they would face in MetLife Stadium, members of the Los Angeles Rams confirmed for reporters Tuesday that they have been simulating their upcoming game against the Giants by pumping crowd groans through speakers. “We know the groans are going to be extremely loud there, and we want to get a feel for what it’s like to play in that environment,” said Rams head coach Sean McVay, noting that the team had surrounded the practice field with concert speakers blaring recordings of injured cattle to help mimic game conditions in which the sighs and grumbling often become so deafening that players cannot hear the snap count. “That noise is what Giants fans are known for; they feed off each other and the action on the field to create that ear-splitting groaning, so we need to be ready. Though I’ll be the first to tell you, even with the speakers, it’s impossible to fully recreate the despair of a Giants game.” McVay added that he is confident the Rams won’t be distracted by New York fans sitting behind their sideline shouting at them to come play for the Giants."
Eagles Ask Fans To Throw Bottles Responsibly,"PHILADELPHIA—Sources confirmed that the Philadelphia Eagles aired a stadium PSA before the kickoff of Monday night’s game asking fans to throw their bottles responsibly. “Hey fans, we’d like to take a moment to encourage all of those at Lincoln Financial Field to exercise good judgement when hurling beer bottles onto the field,” said quarterback Carson Wentz during the 30-second video played on the jumbotron, adding that it was important to make the game-day experience a safe and enjoyable one. “Please remember that you may only hurl beer bottles purchased in the stadium, and that throwing excessively may result in security being forced to escort you out of the game. And, of course, whipping beer bottles while under the age of 21 is strictly prohibited inside the stadium. Now let’s go, Eagles!” Sources confirmed that the video was immediately met by a chorus of deafening boos."
NCAA Suspends Penn State Another 3 Years After Remembering Everything They Did,"INDIANAPOLIS—Saying the decision would become effective immediately, The NCAA announced Saturday that it was suspending the Penn State football team another three years after remembering everything they did. “Holy shit, you know what, you guys are definitely getting suspended again for all that shit,” said NCAA President Mark Emmert, revealing that after the entire NCAA board suddenly recalled that high-level people throughout Penn State deliberately protected a child rapist for decades, the program would be banned from playing games until 2020. “I can’t believe we didn’t give you motherfuckers a lifetime ban to begin with. What the hell were we thinking? That’s some seriously fucked-up shit that nobody should ever get away with.” Emmert then added that there would be “no fucking way” the NCAA would hear any appeals from Penn state."
Scientists Discover 99% Of NFL Players’ Brains Slimy,"SEATTLE—In a major advancement of the ongoing effort to better understand the specific neurobiology of these athletes, a new study released Wednesday by scientists at the University Of Washington revealed that 99 percent of NFL players’ brains are slimy. “After conducting an exhaustive, years-long examination of the donated brains of deceased former players across a wide range of ages, our team confirmed that nearly all of them are covered in slimy, wet goop,” said lead scientist Richard Hurley, who explained that, of the 202 organs studied, a staggering 199 were “all mushy and slippery” when held, with 163 leaving behind some sort of gunk on their laboratory examination gloves. “In more than two-thirds of these cases, the corpus callosum was identified as a common point of goo buildup, acting as a trench between the two hemispheres for the sticky brain juice to pool up. Consistent across the vast majority of brains, however, was a coat of yucky glop that, universally, was sticky and gross to touch.” The study comes on the heels of a Boston University study, which found that 2 percent of NFL players’ brains could survive being accidentally stepped on after falling onto the laboratory floor."
MLB Warns Homerun Hitters League Almost Out Of Balls,"NEW YORK—Cautioning players to think twice before taking any more big swings at the plate this season, the MLB warned its home-run hitters Monday that they’re almost completely out of baseballs. “Just so you all know, we’re down to like, 12 balls, so please keep that in mind before you try to crank any more out of the park,” read the league’s official statement released to the remaining four playoff teams, emphasizing that batters will need to change their habits if they want the sport to continue through the end of the World Series. “If everyone could chip in with singles, doubles, or even triples, that would go a long way. ’Cause once we’re out of balls, we’re done.” The statement went on to add that, in light of the shortage, catchers will have to be far less picky about which balls are too dirty to throw back to the pitcher."
Houston Residents Admit World Series Win Won’t Heal Hurricane-Ravaged City As Much As Super Bowl Win Would,"HOUSTON—The Houston populace admitted to reporters Tuesday night that the Astros’ World Series victory will not heal the hurricane-ravaged city quite as much as a Super Bowl win would. “This will do a lot for us, but to be perfectly honest, it’s not going to usher in the same kind of renewed hope and pride we’d get from watching J.J. Watt lifting the Lombardi Trophy in February,” said Houston resident Daryl Northrup, who echoed the sentiments of his fellow 2.3 million Houston residents by adding that, while he certainly appreciated all that the Astros had accomplished, seeing the team celebrate on the field was probably barely enough to get the devastated city halfway back onto its feet. “Don’t get me wrong, I’m thrilled we won. That being said, this is Texas, and when it comes down to it, a Super Bowl-winning touchdown is really the transformative sports moment that would truly bring the city together.” Houston’s residents then assured reporters that the World Series win would still go a long way toward getting hammered tonight."
Embarrassed Health Guru Informs Tom Brady He’s Been Mistakenly Following Toxic Diet Regimen,"BROOKLINE, MA—Rushing into the home of the New England Patriots quarterback and snatching a protein powder shake out of his hand, embarrassed health guru Alex Guerrero reportedly informed Tom Brady Monday that he’s been mistakenly following a toxic diet regimen this whole time. “Oh my god, Tom, there’s been a mistake—this diet is potentially fatal,” said a panicked and humiliated Guerrero before quickly throwing out all the food in Brady’s house while informing the two-time NFL MVP that he had recently come across research debunking any health benefits of his strict nutritional habits. “If you don’t stop this diet immediately, your muscles will atrophy, your skin is going to wither, and we’re looking at multiple organ failures within the next month. Jesus, we’ve got to get you off of this nightshade-free diet right away. Quick, you need to start eating bread and potatoes. Christ, what the hell were we thinking?” At press time, Guerrero added that Brady’s ill-advised workout regimen may actually render him immobile by age 45."
Documentary Crew’s Night Vision Camera Captures Inquisitive Jim Harbaugh Poking Lens,"ANN ARBOR, MI—Boasting that an incredible unplanned shot perfectly captured the true nature of the Michigan football head coach, a documentary crew filming the team’s 2017 season revealed Wednesday that its static night vision camera positioned on the field had caught an inquisitive Jim Harbaugh poking its lens. “The camera first captured him coming onto the field at 2:30 a.m., but he was just rapidly pacing and dropping down for push-ups,” said director Felicia Comerford, who revealed that Harbaugh then froze, narrowed his eyes, and intently studied the camouflaged camera that he had spotted in pitch-black darkness 120 yards away from him. “Then he suddenly burst toward the camera in a full sprint. He was on it in seconds. He apprehensively circled around it several times and then disappeared off camera, popping up two seconds later inches in front of the lens, sniffing it, poking it with his finger, and then licking it.” Comerford added that the magnificent shot even tops the stunning and unexpected footage they captured the previous day of a pacing Harbaugh suddenly tearing into a freshman linebacker."
Fans Increasingly Unable To Recover In Time For Thursday Night Games,"PHILADELPHIA—Pushing back on the NFL’s efforts to increase the number of prime-time broadcasts, sources confirmed Thursday that NFL fans are increasingly unable to recover in time for Thursday night games. “Look, after the intense pounding we take for hours on Sundays, there’s just no way we can be back at our best four days later for a Thursday night game,” said Philadelphia Eagles fan Jacob Ginter, who noted that on Monday mornings he typically suffers pounding headaches and struggles to even get out of bed and climb down a full flight of stairs. “Having a short week is a killer. Hey, I love the game as much as the next guy, but we need time to heal and get back to full speed.” Ginter then added that, like most fans, adding more weeks of football to the regular season would likely be too much for his body to handle."
On-Field Reporter Acting Like No Big Deal That Coach Just Walked Away Mid-Interview,"OXFORD, OH—Sources confirmed Saturday that ESPN sideline reporter Laura Rutledge is acting like it is no big deal that Notre Dame football head coach Brian Kelly just walked away in the middle of their halftime interview. “What does the defense– oh, oh, thanks, coach,” said Rutledge, who reportedly continued to smile resolutely toward the camera as if the coach had not just begrudgingly given a rushed, rote answer to her first question and then proceeded to storm off in the middle of her follow-up about the team bouncing back in the second half. “Back to you guys upstairs.” At press time, Rutledge was pretending not to notice the stream of sweat pouring onto her from the player she was speaking with during a postgame interview."
Little League Team Spends 18 Minutes Getting Ball Back To Pitcher,"LIVONIA, MI—Eliciting a chorus of mumbles and reluctant encouragement from the crowd, sources reported Thursday that a local little league team spent 18 minutes getting the ball back to their pitcher during a playoff game. Witnesses claim the ordeal began after a pop fly foul ball when 9-year-old outfielder Tyler Mitchell’s throw back to the infield failed to even reach the cut-off man, and whose second throw back after a slow jog up to the ball was then inexplicably picked off by the third baseman. The panicked third baseman then reportedly overthrew the pitcher, prompting calls of “Behind you!” from the crowd as the ball rolled past the distracted first basemen who had wandered to tackle the right fielder. At press time, sources had confirmed that after finally receiving the ball, the pitcher simply walked off the mound to talk to his coach in the dugout."
Vikings Coaching Staff Refuses To Panic About Flickering Dalvin Cook,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN—Saying the rookie running back was merely “working through something,” members of the Minnesota Vikings coaching staff told reporters Tuesday that they are not going to panic over a flickering Dalvin Cook. “Yeah, we’ve been seeing Dalvin blinking in and out of sight a few times, but we’re not really concerned,” said offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, confirming rumors that the starting tailback had been spotted fluttering in and out of the visible spectrum after their last game, but that trainers had cleared him to participate in all team activities this week. “Today, he quickly disappeared for a brief second before flashing back into sight, but we asked him about it and he said he was fine. We’re keeping it on our radar, and we’ll give [running back] Latavius [Murray] some extra reps this week just in case, but we’re confident Dalvin’s going to be 100 percent on Sunday.” Shurmur then added it would be premature to rule out Stefon Diggs for Sunday’s game after the wide receiver dissolved into a gaseous ball."
Holder Fucking Sick Of Giving Kicker Little Pep Talks After Every Missed Field Goal,"WEST LAFAYETTE, IN–Michigan holder Garrett Moores is fucking sick of giving little pep talks to his team’s kicker every time he misses a field goal, sources confirmed during Saturday’s game between Michigan and Purdue. “Jesus Christ, this shit is getting old,” Moores reportedly thought to himself after patting the kicker on the shoulder pads and offering words of support while the rest of the team jogged off the field following the missed field goal. “I told him he’d get it next time, but honestly that’s bullshit. He’s like a 50/50 shot out there and I can’t keep up this faking any longer.” At press time, Moores was reluctantly taking a seat next to the kicker, who was sitting completely alone on the bench."
Vanderbilt Chancellor Recommends Fans Get Vaccinated Before SEC Road Schedule Begins,"NASHVILLE, TN—Stressing the importance of the fan base’s health and wellbeing, Vanderbilt University chancellor Nicholas Zeppos advised Commodore football fans Thursday to get vaccinated before the team’s Southeastern Conference road schedule begins next week. “Those of you travelling into parts of the country like Gainesville, Oxford, or Columbia will be exposing yourself to a wide array of diseases and viruses, and we strongly urge you to consult with your doctor and ensure your immunizations are up to date prior to the start of SEC play,” Zeppos said in an email to Vanderbilt students, faculty, and alumni, urging them to carefully consider the risks before choosing to attend any conference road games. “Whether you’re traveling into the East or West division, adequate precautions are vital. In the event you or your healthcare provider are unable to take the proper steps towards vaccination, we ask that you remain home for your own safety and that of the entire Vanderbilt community.” The advisory concluded by reminding fans that anyone planning on attending a road game tailgate should visit the Student Health Center for free typhoid tablets."
NFL Pregame Ceremony Honors Retired 52-Year-Old Cornerback As Oldest Living Former Player,"SEATTLE—Eliciting a standing ovation for the longtime Seahawk’s cornerback as he gripped his walker and slowly hobbled to midfield, the NFL conducted a pregame ceremony to honor 52-year-old Ronald Dutton as the league’s oldest living former player. “Ever since my father retired in 2002, he has missed being out on the field, and he would like you all to know how thrilled and excited he is to be honored by you all today,” said Dutton’s 22-year-old daughter Kayla as the hunched and visibly confused former Pro Bowler was directed to look into the camera for a photo-op with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell before gingerly attempting to lift his arm and wave to the roaring crowd. “We would like to thank the NFL for taking the time to salute their alumni, especially when those like my father have so little time left. Though as happy as he is today, I just know he wishes all of his teammates were still alive to be here with him.” Following the ceremony, Dutton’s family reportedly returned him to his assisted living home after the Seahawk’s great drifted to sleep in the stands during the first quarter."
NHL Warns Hockey Fans That Banging On Glass Scares Players,"NEW YORK—In an effort to improve overall safety for both competitors and spectators, NHL officials issued a warning Friday to remind hockey fans that banging on the glass scares the players. “Fans attending games should refrain from pounding on the glass as it’s very disorienting and aggravating for hockey players and can even cause them to exhibit extremely violent behavior,” said commissioner Gary Bettman, explaining that the loud noises often confuse and irritate players who have been known to attack each other or injure themselves when smashing their massive bodies into the glass. “Remember, hockey players are incredibly aggressive and easily startled by the reverberations—we have no way of predicting how they will react. Fans should also avoid making direct eye contact as competitors will think they are being challenged, especially during playoff season.” Bettman added that fans should closely supervise their young children to ensure they don’t climb into the rink."
John Cena Gets Argyle Wool Singlet Out From Cedar Chest In Preparation For AutumnSlam,"TAMPA, FL—Moving aside the plastic tubs full of Christmas ornaments and cardboard boxes of old books stored in his attic, professional wrestler John Cena took out his brown argyle singlet from a cedar chest in preparation for AutumnSlam, sources confirmed Tuesday. “I always love when October comes around because I get to snuggle up in my warm, cozy singlet and utterly annihilate a couple close challengers,” said Cena while removing his favorite V-cut wrestling uniform from the moth ball-filled chest before pressing his nose against it and fondly recalling the unforgettable kick-outs and stepover toehold facelocks from AutumnSlams past. “Really, what’s better than going up to New England as the leaves start to change and jumping off the ropes with a fist drop to your opponent’s head? Man, I’m getting excited just thinking about the warm apple cider mist Triple H always spits out after entering the ring.” At press time, sources confirmed Cena was quietly humming while stringing the new laces for his wool-lined, duck-toed wrestling boots."
Refs Let 49ers Put As Many Men On Field As They Want,"SEATTLE—Sighing into the microphone as he stood at the 50-yard line of Centurylink Field, NFL referee Gene Steratore ruled during Sunday’s game that the San Francisco 49ers could put as many men on the field as they want. “You know what, the offense may have however many guys they need on the field to make this fucking thing close,” declared Steratore while waving the 49ers sideline onto the field before picking up the flag he had initially thrown for an illegal substitution. “Put 12 or 13 men in the huddle if you need to, or put the whole goddamn roster on the field. Fuck it, they’re all eligible receivers, too. Go 15-wide if that’s what you gotta do.” At press time, a visibly frustrated Steratore had ruled that, for all he cared, the 49ers could also violently shake an opposing players’ facemask or tear a ball carrier down by the collar if they could get close enough"
CBS Loses Dan Fouts For Season After Blowing Out Larynx On Routine Anecdote,"OAKLAND, CA—Saying that team doctors had confirmed their worst fears after initially seeing the color commentator pull up lame, CBS revealed Sunday that Dan Fouts would miss the remainder of the regular season after blowing out his larynx on a routine anecdote. “Dan has told this story about the 1980 playoffs hundreds of times, but when we saw him come out of the anecdote raspy and wincing we could just tell something was wrong,” said CBS producer Carl Kerry, noting that an MRI of Fouts’ throat revealed severe tearing that would require the veteran broadcaster to undergo vocal cord surgery and miss the entire regular season. “I think he just pushed through the part about Jim Plunkett’s toughness a little too fast and ended up completely shredding his larynx. It was one of those fluke injuries you never see coming. He’s a real warrior, though, and he knows these are the risks you take when you step into the broadcast booth on Sundays.” Despite repeated questions from reporters, Kerry refused to address whether Fouts would be given his starting position in the booth upon returning from his injury."
Stunned Adam Schefter Receives Ominous Tip From Future Self,"BRISTOL, CT—Slowly returning to his desk shaken and confused, sources reported Wednesday that ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter was stunned to receive an ominous tip from his future self while walking through one of his office building’s hallways. “Adam, the rumor I am about to share with you regarding the Kansas City Chief’s cap-space in 2036 would result in unimaginable destruction if it fell into the wrong hands,” said Schefter’s future self, who quickly pulled him into a supply closet and continued issuing a vague warning as the pale, overwhelmed current-day Schefter demanded to know who the gray-haired man was and how he found him. “I must make this quick, so all I can tell you now is that nothing will ever be the same if the Chiefs refuse to address their depth in the secondary through free agency that year. It would be a disaster of epic proportions and set in motion a domino effect the likes of which we have never seen before. But remember, you must protect this secret with your life or risk bringing about the end of the NFL as we know it.” At press time a sweat-soaked Schefter had reportedly taken a deep breath before tweeting “Jeremy Kerley to Jets” to his 6 million Twitter followers."
FanSided’ Ranks All 128 NFL Teams,"NEW YORK—As part of its comprehensive professional football coverage in anticipation of the upcoming season, sports news site FanSided published an article Tuesday ranking all 128 NFL teams. “From the best in the game, all the way down to the bottom of the barrel, we’re analyzing each and every one of the 128 professional footballs teams in all 32 divisions,” featured columnist Ryan Wooden wrote in the introduction to the slideshow, which reportedly includes two slides for each team—one explaining its ranking and one simply displaying the team’s name. “We took an extensive look at every squad in the league and identified the teams to beat in the NFC, AFC, EFC, and RFC conferences. Be sure to check back next week, when we’re going to be rolling out a series of slideshows taking a look at every single matchup for all 42 weeks of the regular season.” According to sources, the slideshow was the site’s most viewed article since last month’s list of the NFL’s top 500 tacklebacks."
"Disturbing Report Reveals Cruel, Disgusting Conditions For Prospects Kept In MLB Farm System","NEW YORK—Calling the inhumane treatment a disgrace to the MLB and all of its consumers, a disturbing new report released Thursday by Sporting News revealed the cruel, disgusting conditions for prospects kept in the MLB farm system. “Our investigation found that these young, helpless prospects are often forced to live in cheap motel rooms containing only a hard, moldy bed while working out in dingy gyms choked with the fetid stench of sweat and gatorade,” said report author Stephanie Bisson, who noted that prospects are often shuttled between rundown southern ballparks in cramped, overcrowded motorcoaches. “These players should be given the room to grow into major leaguers, but instead they are forced into horrific assembly-line conditions that break their spirits and oftentimes lead to horrific injuries. Pitchers, outfielders, and catchers alike are essentially being tortured as they wait around to one day be cut and discarded.” The damning report added that the horrible conditions may also increase aggressiveness among players and lead to violent, bench-clearing brawls."
Wrigley Field Grounds Crew Feed Buckets Of Raw Meat To Hungry Ivy,"CHICAGO—Standing several feet back as they tossed a ground-up, blood-soaked mixture of beef and pig meat toward the outfield walls, members of the Wrigley Field grounds crew reportedly spent Tuesday afternoon feeding buckets of raw meat to the ballpark’s hungry ivy. “In order to keep the ivy healthy and lush, we have to make sure to maintain its diet of at least 600 pounds of meat per day,” Cubs head groundskeeper Roger Baird told reporters, raising his voice so he could be heard over the guttural gnashing and slurping sounds of the ivy as it feasted on its food. “We have consistent feeding times every day at 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 9 p.m. If we miss any feedings, the ivy gets pretty upset and starts making loud groaning noises, so we’re very diligent about the schedule. And we always have to remind fans to never feed the ivy, both because of its diet and for safety reasons.” At press time, in anticipation of the Cubs game later in the day, workers were cleaning up the bone shards and chunks of cartilage that the ivy had spit back out all over the outfield."
Callaway 9 Iron Once Again Named Golf Digest’s Best Club For Smashing In Cheating Ex’s Windshield,"DES MOINES, IA–After exhaustive testing of nearly every style and design on the market, the Callaway 9 Iron was once again named by Golf Digest on Monday the best golf club for smashing in the windshield of a cheating ex. “Factoring in qualities like shatter radius, overhead swing speed, and shock absorption, the Callaway 9 Iron continues to set itself apart as the ideal club to batter the windshield of an unfaithful former lover,” read the highly anticipated study conducted annually for the world’s wronged partners seeking even just the slightest edge to their windshield smashing abilities. “The lightweight shaft and mid-sized clubface offer superior control and force of impact that few competitors can match. Whether the adulterous old flame’s car is parked, moving forward, or skidding away in reverse, no club is better suited to puncture and destroy their windshield than the Callaway 9 Iron.” The magazine’s study also found the Ping Vault to be the best putter for children to pretend to use as a cane while walking around the driveway."
Friend Not In Fantasy League Immediately Regrets Attending Draft Party,"NUTLEY, NJ—Recounting the participants’ unwavering, single-minded focus throughout the three-hour event, local man Ross Harrison, who declined to join his friends’ fantasy football league, told reporters Friday he immediately regretted attending their draft party last night. “Pete just had a kid and Brian got engaged, so I was hoping to catch up with everyone there, but after the night kicked off with a 10-minute debate about adding a second flex spot I instantly knew I’d made a terrible mistake,” said Harrison, who added that, minutes after arriving, he was pulled aside by three different friends who each excitedly shared their respective strategies for the evening’s 14-round draft. “I guess I expected we would drink and shoot the shit while they just picked whatever players the ESPN app recommended for each pick, and instead it was total silence as they flipped through their fantasy football magazines. I got so bored I ended up watching a preseason game in the living room by myself most of the night.” At press time, Harrison had just received his 37th text message assessing last night’s draft on the group chat he shares with his friends."
Manager Can’t Remember Why He Came Out To Mound,"HOUSTON—Visibly irritated with himself as he paced around the pitcher’s plate after calling for time during the fourth inning of their game against the Washington Nationals, Houston Astros manager A.J. Hinch could not remember why he came out to the mound in the first place, sources confirmed Thursday. “Man, I definitely ran out here for something important, but, for the life of me, I have no idea what is was,” Hinch reportedly said to himself while staring at the ground and quickly running through a mental checklist of everything that might have been on his mind over the past few innings as starting pitcher Dallas Keuchel quietly stared at him. “The fastball is looking fine. The offspeed stuff has been good. The pitch count is low and there aren’t any baserunners. Christ, now I feel like a fucking idiot for stopping the game just for this.” At press time, a flustered Hinch had reportedly returned to his seat in the dugout only to realize he had accidentally taken the pitcher’s ball with him."
Diehard 8-Year-Old Buffalo Bills Fan Showing Early Signs Of Masochism,"WEST SENECA, NY—Expressing a mixture of alarm and heartache over the boy’s recently discovered disorder, the parents of diehard 8-year-old Buffalo Bills fan Cody Brenner told reporters Tuesday that their son had begun showing early signs of masochism. “A year ago we identified the first stages of his condition, and it’s been absolutely devastating as a parent to see our little boy struggling with something like this,” said the boy’s mother Julia, noting with sadness that the little boy’s self-flagellation includes watching the entirety of every Bills preseason game, regularly checking their official team Twitter page, and, in perhaps the most tragic and definitive confirmation of his disorder, recently purchasing a Tyrod Taylor poster to proudly display in his bedroom. “I thought something might be wrong when Cody made himself so angry by obsessively rewatching clips of the Bills blowing late-game leads last year, but it was his insistence that they’re going to be good this season in the face of all objective reasoning that confirmed his masochism for me. I want to help him, but we’ve been told there’s very little we can do. I just hope he can stay strong, because he will most likely be dealing with this for the rest of his life.” The boy’s grief-stricken mother added that it was hard not to blame the boy’s condition on his father, a sadist who likely inflicted his longtime Bills fandom on his son."
Man Must Think It Enough To Wear Blackhawks Jersey At Cubs Game,"CHICAGO—Disappointed and irritated by his half-hearted display of fandom, sources reported Tuesday that local man Paul Winslow must have thought that it was enough to wear a Chicago Blackhawks jersey to a Chicago Cubs game. “I guess this fucking guy assumes he’s covered because the Blackhawks also play in Chicago?” said onlooker Daryl Culliver, 32, adding that the man seemingly could not be bothered to wear a jersey, or even a T-shirt, representing the team he actually came to see. “Look around, bud, we’re at a Cubs game. You think you can just half-ass it by waltzing in with a [Jonathan] Toews jersey and then act like you’re one of us? Christ, where the hell does this guy even get off?” Sources added that they were currently undecided about whether to pass judgment on a woman in the stands wearing a yellow shirt that simply read “Chicago.”"
Cruel Broadcast Gods Rip Away Bonus Coverage Of Football Game,"NEW YORK—Demonstrating their callous indifference to human suffering, the cruel broadcast gods ripped away CBS’ bonus coverage of Sunday’s game between the Raiders and Titans, sources confirmed this afternoon. “Okay, due to NFL rules, we’re now going to have to take you back to the studio,” said the cold, unfeeling disembodied voice as the unexpected extra footage of the matchup bestowed on the millions of television viewers was swiftly and coldly ripped away from their clutch just after they had become fully engrossed in the game’s closing minutes. “We’ll be sure to keep you updated on the score. For now, let’s take a look at some of the highlights from around the the league.” At press time, sources confirmed that the heartless broadcast gods from Fox were informing their viewers that some of them would be watching the Carolina Panthers versus the San Francisco 49ers instead of the coveted late game between the Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers."
Larry Fitzgerald Confident He Has Couple Lousy Seasons That Undercut Entire Career Left In Him,"GLENDALE, AZ—Saying he was not ready to hang up his cleats just yet, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald told reporters Wednesday that he’s confident he still has a couple lousy seasons that undercut his entire career left in him. “I might be 33, but I can still put up a few 300-yard seasons where I miss enough games that people slowly forget just how incredible a player I was,” said Fitzgerald, who claimed he was physically and mentally prepared to tarnish his Hall of Fame career by hanging around two seasons too long before being forced into retirement by a debilitating injury. “Everyone here knows I can still contribute by failing to shake cornerbacks I used to blow by, or grabbing the occasional touchdown that gives people a mere glimpse of my former self. I definitely have enough serviceable three-catch performances left in the tank to make sure that’s how people always remember me.” Fitzgerald added that he hopes to eventually ride off into the sunset by playing a minor role on a Cardinals team that starts the season red-hot before missing the playoffs entirely."
Area Man Will Be Judge Of Whether Woman Actually True Baseball Fan,"CHICAGO—Saying that he alone could determine the legitimacy the woman’s claim, area man Luke Haggerty will be the judge of whether coworker Delia Carroll is actually a true baseball fan, sources confirmed Wednesday. “She says she’s a huge baseball fan, but we’ll just see about that,” said Haggerty, peppering the woman with seemingly innocuous questions about the current National League standings and her thoughts on recent trades in order to covertly ascertain the true scope of her expertise. “Hey, where’s your favorite place to sit in Wrigley? Know who’s pitching tonight? Who are some of your favorite players from the ’90s?” At press time, Haggerty grudgingly deemed the woman a true baseball fan, but emphasized she’d never be the fan he was."
Study: 0% Of People Die From Getting Fingers Lodged In Bowling Ball And Being Dragged Down Lane,"WASHINGTON—Saying the deadly mishap had no impact whatsoever on mortality rates in any demographic, a new Pew Research Center study released Tuesday found that zero percent of people die from getting their fingers lodged in a bowling ball and being dragged down the lane. “Our sample of 10,000 Americans found that on average, zero out of 100 people die from getting their fingers stuck in a bowling ball, being yanked onto the lane when they throw their arm forward, and launching headfirst into the pins,” said researcher Sarah Wheatman, noting that skull fractures and other head traumas resulting from such collisions were found on not a single occasion. “As no one has been carried the length of their lane into the pins by the momentum of their bowling ball, it is also necessarily true that not a single person left a 7-10 split after doing so. Our study also confirms that 0 percent of deaths resulted in the person’s body being cleared from the bowling lane by the sweeper before the pins were reset.” Wheatman went on to say, however, that approximately 50 percent of individuals suffer bruises and other minor injuries after their bowling ball pulls them halfway down the lane."
Girlfriend Surprises Rob Gronkowski With Relaxing Couple’s CAT Scan,"BOSTON–Snuggling up together in the peaceful serenity of the Massachusetts General Hospital radiology room, sources confirmed Thursday that New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski was surprised by his girlfriend with an afternoon of relaxing couple’s CAT scans. “After a long week of practice, it was great being able to lie down along a padded bed and slowly slide through the imaging machine’s gantry with my girlfriend by my side,” said Gronkowski, adding that the week’s stress melted away as soon as he heard the calming whirr of the scanner and felt the the contrast dye coursing through his veins. “This is why my girlfriend’s the best. We’ve done ‘his and hers’ neurological exams before, but nothing releases the tension of the workweek like getting a cross-sectional image of our torsos. It really was great being able to take time out and connect in together under a magnetic field and radio waves.” The couple reportedly followed up the scans with a lumbar drain, which Gronkowski told reporters hurt at first but eventually felt “fucking amazing.”"
Cleveland Browns Players Amazed By Star Rookie Comfortable Walking Around Shirtless,"CLEVELAND—Generating an excited buzz throughout the first three weeks of training camp, Cleveland Browns coaches and players have been amazed by how comfortable star rookie defensive end Myles Garrett appears walking around shirtless, sources confirmed Monday. “In my eleven seasons here, we’ve never had a guy with this kind of confidence and swagger,” said left tackle Joe Thomas, noting that a stunned hush fell over the team on the first day of training camp as they stared at Garrett in absolute awe when he self-assuredly jogged out onto the field for warmups wearing nothing but mesh shorts. “He’s never given being shirtless a second thought, you can tell he’s just that fucking bold and poised. It’s incredible having somebody around who has no doubt they can pull off that off, and I know it’s starting to rub off on the other guys.” At press time, sources confirmed that the entire team had timidly gathered to witness Garrett make eye contact with a reporter during a post-practice interview."
MLB Unveils Memorial For Runners Stranded On Base,"NEW YORK—Solemnly ringing a bell 30 times for each of the teams that lost potential runs this season, Major League Baseball officials unveiled Tuesday a memorial outside league headquarters to commemorate all of the runners who have ever been stranded on base. “Today we honor the countless, brave ballplayers who got on base but never made it to home,” said commissioner Rob Manfred, who was joined by the tearful wives and children of the stranded baserunners during a somber ceremony that concluded with the reveal of the bronze statue of a player holding his hips on second base. “May we never forgot those who legged out a double or stole second base only to be stranded in scoring position, as well as the poor, desperate souls who spent an entire inning on third waiting for an RBI that never came. Their teams are forever indebted to the sacrifices they made along the base path, and with this statue, we will always remember that these men are more than just an item in the box score.” According to MLB sources, players also will begin wearing a black patch this season to honor those baserunners who were caught and never made it out of a pickle."

That’s the kind of grass I want on my field. It has the true heart of a champion, and watching it out there putting in a hard day’s work always gets me jacked up.” Harbaugh then confirmed for reporters that he had cut several thousand blades of grass from the field this week after determining they did not meet his expectations for Michigan turf"
Heinz Introduces New Quick-Recovery Sports Ketchup,"PITTSBURGH—Calling it a perfect way to rapidly replenish essential nutrients after an intense workout, Heinz on Wednesday introduced a new quick-recovery sports ketchup to their line of food products. “Our new Post-Workout Recovery Ketchup is specially formulated with electrolytes and a dozen other minerals to help you rehydrate, re-energize, and get back in the game,” said Heinz spokesperson Danny Paylor of the condiment, which comes in both bottles and single ketchup packets he described as a “great on-the-go energy squirt” for athletes. “Whether it’s serious cardio or heavy reps on weights, this ketchup is supercharged with enough potassium and magnesium to restore you to peak performance fast—you don’t want to hit the gym without it.” Paylor went on to say that the ketchup works most effectively if paired with Heinz’s new Pre-Workout Homestyle Relish"
Report: Pickup Basketball Player Too Sweaty To Guard,"MEMPHIS, TN—Allowing his competitive spirit to give way to revulsion, local 27-year-old Philip Rayburn reported Thursday that a fellow pickup basketball player was too sweaty to guard. “I know I need to stay on him when he starts trying to back me down in the post, but I really don’t want to touch his sopping wet back,” said Rayburn, who on no less than six occasions passively gave up the lane rather than risk banging into the sweat-drenched man barreling toward him. “I don’t even like boxing him out on rebounds because he just drips down on top of me. Christ, I can’t even hand check him without getting wet.” At press time, the man had reportedly just returned from a water break dripping from the mouth with a combination of drool, sweat, and Gatorade."
Rec Sports League Organizer Needs To Cool It With The Emails,"BAKERSFIELD, CA—Citing the frequent and unnecessary missives sent out at all hours of the day, sources confirmed Friday that the league representative from the company Bakersfield Sportz needed to cool it with all the emails. “Jesus Christ, this guy just sent us another fucking update on the league standings,” player Tyler Judson reportedly said to himself after reading the latest email, which, according to sources, was just one of six sent that week alone that included reminders to bring plenty of water and make sure they had enough players to field a team. “This guy needs to seriously slow his roll with all of these goddamn messages. Yeah, we know the game is on field two and that there’s a 20 percent chance of rain for the game. We all have an internet connection. I mean, holy shit, just relax buddy.” At press time, livid sources confirmed that the league organizer had begun sending out group text messages."
John Cena Purchases $4 Million 18th-Century Wrought Iron Cage At Auction,"NANTUCKET, MA—Narrowly outbidding dozens of other competitors to take home the rare and precious antique, professional wrestler John Cena reportedly purchased an 18th-century wrought iron cage at auction Monday for $4 million. “When you see the attention to detail on each and every beam, especially in the corners by the ring posts, you realize the remarkable craftsmanship that used to go into welding one of these,” Cena said of the 20-ton collector’s piece while admiring the ornate ribbon patterns adorning the cage’s single 12-foot gate that wrestlers of the era once angrily swung open before participating in no-holds-barred matches. “There’s certainly some pitting and slight corrosion near the top where wrestlers would have hung before crashing down for a leg drop, but otherwise it’s in incredible condition for its age. I’ve always loved the look of these hand-forged lantern hooks they used to light up the ring, but they were largely phased out by the1780s, which makes this an exceptionally unique piece indeed.” At press time, Cena was reportedly emitting a thunderous, primal scream after movers accidentally dropped the cage while transporting it into his home."
Dale Earnhardt Jr. Submits Paperwork For Gas Reimbursement,"LONG POND, PA—Hunching over the steering wheel of his idling No. 88 Chevrolet SS to closely inspect the odometer, NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. was reportedly in the process of submitting paperwork Monday to reimburse his gas expenses for the month. “Let’s see, how many miles was that Saturday?” Earnhardt reportedly said to himself before jotting down the mileage total, his full legal name, and the date of his 2017 Overton’s 400 race onto a form titled “2017 Driver Reimbursement Requests,” before rifling through his glove compartment to find a missing gas receipt from a race earlier in the month. “Jesus, this whole thing is always such a fucking hassle, and of course H.R. is going to send this right back to me because I filled out something wrong, like they always do. I’m still owed like 10 grand from the 2016 Sprint Cup Series, for Christ’s sake.” At press time, Earnhardt was reportedly explaining to Overton 400 winner Kyle Busch that the NOS energy drink he sprayed everywhere following his victory can count as a meal reimbursement."

When people visit the Hall of Fame, they’ll be able to see what it was really like to make so much money playing baseball.” Idelson added that the Hall of Fame is also seeking to acquire some of the $80,000 Babe Ruth made in 1930."
Area Man Installs Home Pull-Up Bar To Absentmindedly Tap While Passing Through Hallway,"CHARLOTTE, NC—Saying it has already become a fixture in his daily routine, local 27-year-old Greg Weise installed a home pull-up bar to absentmindedly tap while passing through the hallway, sources confirmed Tuesday. “This bar just slips right over almost any doorframe, so it’s really easy to inattentively tap it when I go in and out of my bedroom,” said Weise, who added that the bar’s padding is an excellent surface to idly drum his fingers on as he stands in the doorway. “It’s really convenient to be able to occasionally grab the bar and then lean really far forward to sort of stretch a little bit. Finally, I have something to latch onto and dangle from for a few seconds before returning to sorting my laundry.” At press time, Weise had reportedly also purchased a set of free weights to leave scattered on the ground and stub his toe on when he’s not looking."
Area Stingray Dreaming Of Making It To Tropicana Field Touch Tank,"TAMPA BAY, FL—Calling the 10,000-gallon habitat hallowed ground, a local stingray told reporters Monday that he dreams of one day making it to the Tropicana Field touch tank. “Ever since I was a pup, I’ve always imagined what it would be like to earn a spot in that 35-foot tank just beyond right-center field,” said the adolescent cownose ray, adding that he would like nothing more than to one day hear the roar of the crowd from behind the glass as he flips his tail and burrows into the sand. “It’d be such a thrill to finally rub my flaps along the tank wall as I circle around waiting for my meal. There’s not a day that goes by when I’m not working toward finally swimming through that tank while fans run their hands along my back.” The stingray then added that making it to the Tropicana Tank would finally fulfill the dreams of his late father, who never made it beyond the Tampa Bay Airport RumFish Grill aquarium."
Nike Introduces New Line Of Sauce-Wicking Competitive Eating Apparel,"BEAVERTON, OR—Promising to revolutionize the way athletes gorge, Nike introduced a new line of sauce-wicking apparel for competitive eating Thursday. “Our new polypropylene blend is specially designed to boost performance by absorbing barbecue sauce, blue cheese, ranch, and all manner of drippings to completely eliminate condiment-related discomfort during competitive eating events,” said Nike spokesperson Martin Greaves, adding that the line of T-shirts, shorts, and lightweight jackets swiftly remove excess gravy and jus nearly seven times faster than a crumpled napkin or corner of a tablecloth. “Whether you’re downing ribs during a friendly backyard contest or inhaling chicken wings at the elite level, our sauce-wicking apparel is there at every turn to ensure you are never slowed down by globs of sauce landing on your arms and chest. With our clothing, you will now have the edge to choke down that extra marina-drenched meatball for the win.” Greaves added that the company is also developing a line of extra-thick elbow pads for eaters to use while supporting their heaving, bloated bodies against the table."
Report: Bellagio Voted Best Casino For Standing Around Too Nervous To Approach A Poker Table,"LAS VEGAS—Praising it as the perfect destination for the trepidatious gambler, a new poll released Wednesday in Casino Player magazine voted the Bellagio the best casino for standing around too nervous to approach a poker table. “Our readers overwhelmingly agree that the Bellagio Resort is the number-one spot for would-be poker players to anxiously fiddle with their $100 in chips while staring at the tables from a safe distance,” wrote editor J. Phillip Vogel, noting that the room’s ornate columns and large crowds serve as safe barriers behind which guests can stall as they worry about how much more experienced everyone else appears and how likely they are to reveal themselves as complete novices to their great embarrassment. “People come from all over the world to dawdle at the multiple bars, which allow them to repeatedly grab another drink to calm their nerves after chickening out of their latest promise to themselves that they would claim the next seat that opened up. Furthermore, the room is always crowded with longtime veterans intensely focused on their games, decreasing the likelihood of any employee making eye contact with you and subsequently offering to escort you to a table.” The same issue of Casino Player also named the mojito at the Bellagio the best drink for spilling at the table to distract dealers as you count cards."
‘NBA Hangtime’ Announcer Remembers Calling Scottie Pippen’s Classic Fire Double Dunk Game,"CHICAGO—Telling reporters Monday that it was one of the most memorable two-on-two Tournament Mode games of his storied career, former NBA Hangtime announcer Dick Walters described calling Scottie Pippen’s classic 1997 fire double dunk game. “I could tell Pippen was going to have a good night once he threw down that front flip dunk after winning the opening tip, but I had no idea he would go on to dominate every single possession for all 12 minutes of the game,” said Walters, who recalled impulsively screaming “he jams it in!” at the top of his lungs after Pippen threw a no-look alley-oop pass across the entire court to his werewolf teammate, setting off the 400 fans in an already electric Midway Arena. “People always like to talk about his 47 unanswered points, but what I’ll never forget is the moment he wildly swung his hands around his body to strip Reggie Miller midair before launching himself from behind the three-point line and throwing down a dunk that burst the ball into blue flames. After witnessing that, I felt the only thing left to say was, ‘He’s got skills.’” Walters then conceded that, as great as Pippen’s performance was, nothing could ever reach the heights of the Jungle Court match between the Bulls and Knicks that elicited eight straight “boomshakalaka!”s in the final two minutes."
X Games Dirt Biker Forced To Make Emergency Landing After Bird Gets Caught In Engine,"MINNEAPOLIS—Avoiding a potentially even greater disaster with his split-second decision-making, X Games motocross rider Nate Adams was reportedly forced to make an emergency landing Thursday after a bird flew into his engine during a jump in the Moto X Freestyle Finals. “Striking the bird right after takeoff immediately resulted in full engine failure, and at that point I had no other choice but to bring her down,” said Adams, who was halfway through performing a double backflip at an approximate altitude of 27 feet when he lost all thrust from the damaged 80cc engine and resorted to carefully gliding the bike to an improvised landing on the dirt track. “It was definitely frightening, but in moments like that you really don’t have time to panic. All you can do is trust your training and the thousands of hours of Big Air time you’ve logged. I’m just lucky the firefighters rushed to the scene in time to put out the flames before my bike exploded.” Event officials told reporters that the scary incident was a reminder of the X Games 2007 tragedy, when Best Trick participant Travis Pastrana mysteriously vanished off radar screens mid-flight and was never recovered."
ESPN Holds Daytime ESPYs,"HARTFORD, CT—Recognizing the best in sports programming that occurs on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., ESPN held the Daytime ESPY Awards at the Hartford XL Center Wednesday afternoon. “Viewers of daytime sports saw many incredible athletic efforts this year worthy of being named Best Play, but McKendree University sophomore Lauren Pate’s 2-7-8 spare while competing against Nebraska in the NCAA Women’s Bowling Championships stood out above the rest,” said host and star of General Hospital Matt Cohen to an applauding crowd during a ceremony that also saw competitive eater Joey Chestnut win Best Daytime Championship Performance and the Byron Nelson High School Bobcats football team take home the Best Daytime Upset for their shocking win against Trinity. “Without these great athletes and coaches dazzling us with their guts, skills, and heart, our weekday midafternoons would not be the same. Stay tuned after the break to find out who is this year’s Best Drone Racer.” Sources confirmed that the highlight of the evening came when 2017 PDC World Darts Champion Michael van Gerwen delivered a stirring speech calling for the end of the Syrian Civil War."
Man Hoping Game Gets Out Of Hand So He Can Do Something Else,"DENVER—Settling into his apartment’s cramped living room to watch the midday game, local man Garrett Neubauer told reporters Wednesday that he hoped the televised baseball game between the Colorado Rockies and the San Francisco Giants would get out of hand soon so he could do something else. “If they take, like, a four- or five-run lead, I’ll finally be able to turn this thing off and get some fresh air,” said Neubauer, adding that he was reluctant to abandon the game before he was certain the outcome was locked up and that he would not miss anything. “I’m rooting for the Rockies, but frankly I really don’t care as long as one of them pulls ahead and I can get some work done. I’ve also got to run a few errands, but that’ll never happen if this thing stays close.” At press time, the game had finally become lopsided enough for Neubauer to turn it off and look for another game to watch."
"Versatile Game Table Can Be Easily Converted To Play Small, Shitty Version Of Pool, Air Hockey, Foosball","MINNEAPOLIS—Citing the poor quality of both the design and craftsmanship, members of the Hunter family told reporters Friday that the home’s versatile game table could be easily converted to play small, shitty versions of pool, air hockey, and foosball. “Right now it’s a tiny, cramped foosball table, but if you want to play air hockey on a chintzy rink that doesn’t blow any air at all, then all you have to do is just flip it right over,” said Jeffrey Hunter, 14, noting that the miserable excuse for an air hockey table came equipped with two strikers too small to grip properly and a single puck the size of a casino chip. “It’s got a cheap pool table component that comes with 18-inch billiard cues and shitty miniature balls that are impossible to hit accurately, so you can also play a game that barely resembles pool. This table’s got whatever you might want to play for two minutes before getting completely frustrated and stopping.” At press time, the table’s foosball component had reportedly become even shittier after the missing soccer ball was replaced with the eight ball."
OB-GYN Assures Serena Williams Fetus Developing Serve On Schedule,"WEST PALM BEACH, FL—Observing that the unborn child was producing the smooth, fluid strokes expected in the third trimester, ob-gyn Dr. Theresa Umbers reportedly assured world No. 4–ranked tennis player Serena Williams at an appointment Tuesday that her fetus was developing its serve right on schedule. “As you can see on the ultrasound, your baby is getting great extension on its serve, and if you look closely you can even spot the beginning of a little topspin,” said Umbers, who noted that only a few weeks ago Williams’ child had developed the ability to loosely form a western forehand grip. “Your baby’s pinpoint stance is exactly where you want it to be at 24 weeks. Pretty soon it will be able to generate more power for aggressive serves, and you might even be able to feel its follow-through in the next few days.” According to sources, Williams has chosen to wait until the birth to learn whether her child is a baseline or serve-and-volley player."
Stephen A. Smith Reveals He Still Meets Up With Skip Bayless To Argue,"BRISTOL, CT—Saying that their combative, antagonistic relationship remains as strong as ever, ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith revealed to reporters Monday that he still meets up with his former First Take co-host Skip Bayless to argue. “Even though we don’t work together anymore, Skip and I like to occasionally get together and yell our misinformed, conflicting opinions over one another,” said Smith, adding that the two try to hang out one or two times a month to work themselves into a frenzy squabbling about some of their favorite topics like Tim Tebow, domestic violence, and which NFL quarterbacks are truly elite. “If our schedules don’t allow us to argue in person, we’ll hop on the phone to really lay into how we each think the other one is defending the stupidest possible take. It’s always great to swap insults with Skip, and it certainly brings back a lot of great memories.” Smith then told reporters that Bayless will always occupy a special place in his heart, adding that he could not see himself ever getting as worked up over stupid bullshit with new co-host Max Kellerman."
WWE Staff Forced To Shoot Aggressive Wrestler After Child Climbs Into Steel Cage,"INDIANAPOLIS—Saying they were left with no other choice given the imminent peril of the situation, World Wrestling Entertainment officials confirmed they were forced to kill one of their own stars Friday when a 7-year-old boy wandered into the steel cage enclosure of an aggressive wrestler. Beloved two-time WWE champion Big Show was reportedly shot dead after the emergency response team at the Indiana Farmers Coliseum made a split-second decision to take out the nearly 400-pound dominant male wrestler, who is said to have appeared aggravated and hostile, causing those present to fear for the small child’s safety."
New Report Finds MMA Could Be Bad For Your Knees,"LOS ANGELES—Following a 10-year study of more than 500 professional and amateur fighters, a report released Thursday by the UCLA Department of Physiology found that mixed martial arts could be bad for your knees. “Our findings indicate that many of the repetitive motions used while engaging in bouts of MMA puts participants at significant risk for potential sprains or tightness in the knee joints,” read the report, which added that many common MMA moves, ranging from roundhouse kicks to triangle locks, exert significant pressure on the patellae that might give rise to conditions such as arthritis or bursitis. “Over time, activities like Cage Warriors Fighting Championships can wear away the tissue in the cartilage and result in patellar maltracking, leading to pain and swelling. Our study found that, whether trained in Muay Thai or Combat Sambo, those who compete in The Octagon are jeopardizing their knee health both in the short term and for many years after their fighting days are over.” The report concluded by advising fighters to minimize their risk of incurring knee injuries during fights by wearing a patella band."
MLB Umpires Admit Pitchers Throw Way Too Fast To Actually See Ball,"NEW YORK—Describing the task of calling balls and strikes as mostly guesswork, MLB umpires admitted Thursday that pitchers throw way too fast for them to actually see the ball. “The ball is pretty small and it’s moving really quickly, so even when I’m watching super closely, it’s still impossible to tell,” said home plate umpire Scott Glennon, who further echoed the sentiments expressed by most of his colleagues by adding that pitches like sliders and curveballs move all over the place, making it even harder to tell what happened. “It’s good when the catcher reaches really far away from the plate so I know that it’s probably a ball, or if the batter swings and misses so I don’t have to pretend I knew where the ball went. Otherwise I just have to signal real emphatically to convince everyone I saw it.” Glennon also admitted that, like most of the league’s umps, he simply alternates back and forth between calling “safe” and “out” for every close play at the plate."
Donkey Kong Left Off New ‘Super Smash Bros.’ Game After Failing To Make Weight,"LOS ANGELES—In a stunning development that sent shockwaves through the gaming community, Nintendo announced during their Electronic Entertainment Expo presentation Tuesday that Donkey Kong will be left off the upcoming edition of Super Smash Bros. after failing to make weight. “Donkey Kong’s disappointing disqualification from Super Smash Bros. came after he registered 4.5 pounds over his contractual limit of 750 pounds, despite having drastically decreased his food and water consumption in the week leading up to weigh-in,” wrote Polygon video game reviewer Christian Shunk, referring to the weight limit game officials imposed to maintain a competitive balance between the primate and fellow heavyweights like Wario, King Dedede, and Bowser. “Officials gave Donkey Kong another two hours to try again, and he attempted to eliminate excess body water by sitting in the sauna for a half hour before completing a high-intensity workout on the stationary bike while wearing heavy clothing. However, after testing 1.8 pounds over at the second weigh-in, and following an unsuccessful appeal to the Nintendo Gaming Commission, Donkey Kong was officially ineligible to participate in this edition.” Nintendo officials did confirm that Pikachu is still expected to appear in the upcoming game despite being briefly hospitalized with dehydration and kidney stones stemming from his efforts to make weight.

Ref Quietly Asks Penguins Players If He Can Have A Go At Hoisting Stanley Cup,"NASHVILLE, TN—Timidly approaching members of the Pittsburgh Penguins as they celebrated their championship victory over the Nashville Predators, referee Dan O’Halloran quietly asked several players if he could have a go at hoisting the Stanley Cup, sources confirmed Sunday night. “Hey guys, this has always been kind of a dream of mine, so do you think I could take a turn holding the cup?” O’Halloran was reported to have shyly asked Penguins alternate captain Chris Kunitz after spending several minutes silently lingering just outside the huddle of rejoicing players. “It’s just that this is my eighth Stanley Cup, and in that whole time I’ve never even gotten to touch it. I promise I’ll be really quick, and then you can have it right back.” At press time, O’Halloran was reportedly standing frozen in horror after dropping the Stanley Cup."

Mr. Met’s Son Beginning To Think He Adopted,"NEW YORK—Pointing out that there was little physical resemblance between himself and the rest of his family, the 10-year-old son of New York Mets mascot Mr. Met told reporters Tuesday that he was beginning to think he was adopted. “I’ve always felt a little bit different from the rest of my family, but lately I’ve really started to wonder if I’m actually my parents’ biological child at all,” said Kyle Met, who noted that, in addition to being the only member of his family with blonde hair, he does not share his parents’ bulbous eyes, leathery white skin, and perfectly spherical head. “My brother is a dead ringer for my dad—they both have the same thick, jet-black eyebrows—but I’m sort of a mystery. I asked to see my baby pictures once, and my mom said they’d been lost in a flood. I’d still love them because they’re the ones who raised me, but it would be really nice to know if they’re my real parents.” Met added that his parents have repeatedly assured him he simply inherited the recessive genes of his maternal grandfather."
Cuban Immigrant Can’t Believe He Risked Life Coming To America To Play For AA Birmingham Barons,"BIRMINGHAM, AL—Saying the current experience was not what he bargained for, Cuban immigrant Jorge Fernandez, 24, told reporters Tuesday that he cannot believe he risked his life coming to America to play second base for the AA Birmingham Barons. “Jesus Christ, I spent six days floating across the ocean in a cramped, rusted-out fishing boat just so I could end up playing in front of 40 people in the middle of Alabama,” said a visibly frustrated Fernandez, adding that after leaving behind his entire family, hitchhiking across Cuba to rendezvous with smugglers, and nearly capsizing at sea, he is now paid $2,000 a month to play at some stadium called Regions Field. “It’s a good thing there isn’t anything to do in this hick shithole, because I’m still paying 30 percent of every paycheck to my smugglers for getting me here. I watched two of my friends drown during the crossing, but if I’m lucky I might eventually get invited to play in the Arizona Fall League for the goddamn Glendale Desert Dogs. Give me a fucking break.” At press time, the man who survived on crackers for nearly a week at sea was reluctantly boarding a bus for a five-hour drive to an away game in Biloxi, Mississippi. "
Mom Finds Disturbing Reading Material In Teenage Son’s Bedroom,"OMAHA, NE—Saying she felt disgusted and saddened by the shocking discovery, local woman Beth Loomis told reporters Thursday that she was deeply disturbed after finding recruitment reading material from the Baylor University football team in her teenage son’s bedroom. “I was taking the sheets off Ryan’s bed for washing, and I happened to notice some of these vile images just sitting there tucked underneath his pillow,” said the mother of the highly touted 16-year-old high school quarterback, adding that she “could not believe [her] eyes” upon seeing the glossy Baylor football brochure filled with double-page spreads touting the program’s benefits and encouraging her son to accept an athletic scholarship from the university. “It just sickens me to think that my child is looking at this kind of filth and taking some sort of pleasure in any of it. I honestly thought I raised him better than this.” At press time, Loomis was reportedly sitting her son down to explain how damaging it can be for young men to normalize the kinds of things they see in Baylor football pamphlets."
Carmelo Anthony Confident He Can Still Help Contender Flame Out In First Round,"NEW YORK—Insisting that he’s capable of reaching the same heights as in the past, small forward Carmelo Anthony told reporters Wednesday that he is confident he can still help a contender flame out in the first round. “I may not be in my prime anymore, but I know I still have what it takes to help a team secure a high playoff seed and then get unexpectedly trounced in the first round,” said Anthony, who claimed he has not lost the skills to make an All-Star game, get fans’ hopes up in the regular season, and then implode against an inferior opponent before even reaching the conference championship. “Even if I’m not the number one option, I can help drag down a promising player by dominating the ball with constant one-on-one isolations and be a defensive liability that makes it impossible to beat a true championship contender in the playoffs. Everyone knows I still have plenty of postseason disappointment left in the tank.” Anthony also promised to bring invaluable veteran leadership to any team’s locker room arguments."
Rookie First Baseman Nervous To Chat With Baserunners,"ATLANTA—Noting how important it is to make a good first impression, Pittsburgh Pirates rookie first baseman Josh Bell told reporters before Tuesday’s game against the Atlanta Braves that he’s still nervous about chatting with opposing baserunners. “Gosh, I just hope I don’t say anything stupid to them,” said Bell, who was reportedly concerned about coming off as too eager to talk as well as running out of things to say, especially when interacting with some of the league’s more veteran players. “Am I supposed to talk about the game, or are we supposed to discuss other stuff? I don’t want to seem overly friendly, but I also don’t want to seem like an idiot by acting tough or whatever. Maybe I’ll just play it cool and not say anything.” At press time, Bell was mentally berating himself for blurting out “nice hit” to Braves right fielder Nick Markakis after he took a base on balls."
Nike Releases New Sports Bra For Wearing Directly Under Coat While Shambling Around Grocery Store,"BEAVERTON, OR—Touting the undergarment as an essential item for women on the go, Nike released a new sports bra Monday designed for wearing directly under a coat while shambling around the grocery store, sources reported. “The lightweight Nike Relax Pro fits comfortably beneath any baggy hoodie or windbreaker and offers unparalleled support as you quickly run into Stop & Shop to buy Tostitos,” said Nike spokesperson Melanie Turnett, adding that the sports bra utilizes sweat-wicking material specially equipped to handle hangover-induced perspiration. “As you hurry from one aisle to the next in search of string cheese and Advil, the Relax Pro’s compression knit fabric helps reduce bounce and discomfort. Plus, the bra’s racerback straps allow for a full range of movement in the checkout line as you dig frantically through your bag to find your misplaced debit card.” Turnett added that the bra is part of Nike’s larger Sunday Casual collection that includes torn, coffee-stained sweatpants and athletic sandals with broken straps."
CC Sabathia Chowing Down On Homemade Marinara Baseball Sub,"KANSAS CITY—His face dripping with sauce and strings of mozzarella cheese, New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia was reportedly chowing down on a homemade marinara baseball sub in the team’s dugout Wednesday. “Oh man, there have to be six or seven baseballs in that sandwich, and he’s absolutely going to town on it,” outfielder Brett Gardner said of his teammate, who explained to Gardner that the best way to make the hero was to panfry a couple of Rawlings official league balls and then slow-simmer them in his custom garlic basil tomato sauce before laying them out on a freshly baked foot-long Italian roll atop several slices of mozzarella and a sprinkling of parmesan. “A ball squirted out of the bottom and he just scooped it right up with his glove and popped it straight into his mouth. He’s barely even chewing as he inhales that thing. He’s just a machine.” At press time, a bloated and lethargic Sabathia was reportedly using a toothpick to remove a strand of yarn stuck in his teeth."
Slight Breeze A Major Factor In Wiffle Ball Game,"EDEN PRAIRIE, MN—Wreaking havoc as it slowly blew across the backyard, a slight breeze reportedly played a major factor in the Harelik family’s Wiffle ball game last Sunday. “Normally Uncle Rob is good for a couple big home runs, but nothing was getting over our neighbor’s fence that day with such a gentle summer wind,” said Jordan Harelik, 14, describing the adjustments he and relatives on both teams were forced to make while attempting to bat, throw, and catch the ball through the barely discernible 2 mph east-to-west currents. “The breeze was making Aunt Susan’s pitches hook like crazy, and if she didn’t put some real heat on her throws they died before even making it to the lawn chair we used as a catcher. Tyler was running in circles just trying to catch Mom’s pop fly that kept dancing in the wind, and his drop ended up costing us two runs. It was a real mess out there.” Family members confirmed that gameplay became almost completely impossible in the fourth inning after the ball became slightly dented."
"‘I’m Just Here To Win Football Games,’ Says 22-Year-Old Draft Pick Who Will Get Everyone Fired","CHICAGO—Saying that he is solely focused on becoming the best quarterback possible, a 22-year-old first-round draft pick who will get most of the franchise leadership fired told reporters Monday that he is “just here to win football games.” “Making it to the NFL has always been my dream, and I’m really excited to go out there and have some fun playing the sport I love,” said the second overall pick, whose poor on-field performance and lack of noticeable improvement over the next three years will lead to the terminations of his head coach, offensive coordinator, head scout, GM, and 70 percent of the front office staff before he himself is released the following season. “I just want to show what I’m made of and leave it all out there for the team. I’m ready to prove myself and help take us to the next level.” The draft pick also added he was excited to deliver a championship to the fans that will one day burn his jersey in effigy. "
MLB Recommends Teams Limit Amount Of Screen Time For Rookies,"NEW YORK—Citing the numerous studies linking the overuse of electronic devices to stunted development, the MLB reportedly sent a memo to all 30 teams Tuesday that recommended limiting the amount of screen time for rookies. “During that incredibly important first year, coaches should ideally prohibit players from spending more than two hours per day in front of computers, phones, and TVs,” read the memo authored by MLB medical director Dr. Gary Green, warning that excessive screen time could have significant consequences for rookies’ physical fitness, concentration at the plate, and ability to socialize with teammates. “Although it’s easy and convenient to simply sit rookies down with an iPad or in front of the clubhouse TV to keep them occupied, teams need to realize that these players are still at a precarious place in their cognitive, physical, and emotional development. While there’s no one-size-fits-all approach, rookies’ screen time should be mostly dedicated to high-quality programming, such as tape of opposing pitchers. Ultimately, it’s up to teams to make smart decisions that will benefit their rookies’ long-term growth.” The memo also recommended that coaches designate screen-free times for the whole team, such as group dinners or while in bed at the team hotel."
MLB Bans Cruel Practice Of Castrating Mascots,"NEW YORK—Saying that the “antiquated and barbaric procedure” has no place in modern baseball, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred announced Monday that the league was banning the brutal practice of castrating mascots. “Despite being a long accepted practice among team owners, the MLB executive board has determined that it is unethical and dangerous to perform the invasive act of removing a mascot’s genitals,” said Manfred, responding to public outcry over what many consider to be a cruel surgery, which teams claim makes mascots docile, easy to train, and prevents them from attacking fans. “Mascots are subjected to this gelding as early as their first season with a team, and sadly the procedure is often done without the use of anesthetics. While we need to ensure that mascots can live in close proximity to humans, we believe alternatives like hormone treatments can achieve the same result without resorting to the brutal mutilation of a mascot’s sexual organs.” Manfred expressed hope that the ban would eliminate the last link between the MLB and the horrific early 20th-century practice of using sterilization to remove “inferior” mascots from the gene pool."
Derek Jeter Fulfills Lifelong Dream Of Starting Business Venture With Jeb Bush,"TAMPA, FL—Saying that sitting in the same boardroom together still feels completely surreal, former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter told reporters Thursday that he had finally fulfilled a lifelong dream of starting a business venture with Jeb Bush. “Ever since I was a little kid, all I’ve wanted to do is become equity partners with Mr. Bush,” said the former New York Yankees All-Star, adding that he was first inspired to become a businessman as a child while watching Bush’s entrepreneurial strides in the Latin American banking sphere and his work on his father’s presidential campaigns. “I was only 6 or 7 when Jeb made partner at The Codina Group, but his tireless efforts in securing tenants for commercial developments made me dream of one day recruiting outside investors for our own joint ownership team. I used to stare at the poster of him in my bedroom for hours just imagining us securing a billionaire dollar deal together. I’m still waiting for somebody to wake me up and tell me this is all just a dream.” Jeter also said that the partnership made spending more than two decades working as a professional baseball player completely worth it."
Patriots Draft Pat Patriot’s Successor With Third-Round Pick Of Sophomore LSU Mascot,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—In a bold move to usher the franchise into the future, the New England Patriots reportedly drafted Pat Patriot’s successor Monday by using a third-round pick, 72nd overall, to select sophomore LSU mascot Mike the Tiger.Several reports indicate that the team plans to groom Mike the Tiger to eventually take over for the veteran Pat Patriot, revealing that members of New England’s coaching staff were enamored with the consensus All-American mascot’s nonstop motor, mobility, and elite antics."

I’m allergic. Fuck!” At press time, sources confirmed shortstop Starlin Castro had run out of the stadium and was sprinting down Jerome Avenue."
Skip Bayless Signs 1-Day Contract To Be Fired By ESPN,"BRISTOL, CT—Saying that he could not imagine going out in disgrace anywhere else, Skip Bayless reportedly signed a one-day contract Wednesday to be fired by ESPN. “ESPN is where I got my big break, and I’ve always considered it to be my true home, so I want to thank the network for letting me end my career here with this termination,” said Bayless, who sat next to ESPN president John Skipper while signing the contract consenting to go on a five-minute tirade slamming LeBron James as immature and wildly speculating that multiple NFL players were using performance-enhancing drugs before being summarily fired 24 hours later. “I went on some of my best rants here, and it’s truly a privilege to have one last opportunity to make an indefensible statement and offer a half-hearted apology. I always pictured myself getting fired behind an ESPN desk.” Skipper then praised Bayless after the termination, saying his baseless arguments, high-pitched screaming, and arrogant attitude had helped define ESPN for the last decade."
Area Man Convinced He Could Have Been NFL Bust,"DES MOINES, IA—Insisting that he possessed the physical and mental attributes to be one of the most disappointing draft picks of all time, local man Keith Parker, 34, was reportedly convinced Thursday that he could have been an NFL bust. “I truly believe that I could’ve been a terrible fit for an NFL team and flamed out of the league after a season or two,” said Parker, who was confident that he had the perfect combination of a poor attitude, a lack of focus, and an inherent laziness to fall short of expectations for a first-round draft selection. “I can definitely see myself proving that I’m incapable of handling the game at the professional level by showing up to training camp 20 to 30 pounds overweight and then sucking so bad that I end up at the bottom of the depth chart before eventually getting cut. Plus, I have no shortage of fuckup friends and family to distract me off the field until that happens.”At press time, Parker added that he could also imagine having a short NFL career and then turning to drug abuse and crime."
Mel Kiper Shrugs Off Amorous Feelings Toward Big Board While Working Late One Night,"BRISTOL, CT—Seeing the rolling corkboard in a way he never had before, ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr. reportedly shrugged off amorous feelings toward his 2017 NFL Draft Big Board while working late one night in his office, sources confirmed Tuesday. “We were capping off another marathon workday with a few drinks, which turned into a few more, and the next thing you know we were inches apart and I wasn’t sure I could resist exploring this sudden, undeniable attraction,” said Kiper, adding that working so closely side-by-side for months in preparation for the Draft had slowly eroded the courteous professional distance he had always maintained with the 10-foot-wide bulletin board used to catalog and rank NFL prospects. “Did my mind wander in that special moment to what could have been? Sure. But then I thought of my wife and my daughter, whom I love more than anything in the world, and I remember why I stopped it from going further than a kiss.” Kiper also admitted to reporters that the amount of time fellow analyst Todd McShay has recently begun spending with the Big Board has started to make him jealous and even paranoid."
Dwight Howard Clearly Doesn’t Know Team’s Name,"WASHINGTON—Noting his confused expression and uncertainty while shouting incorrect nicknames throughout the playoff game, sources confirmed Wednesday night that Atlanta Hawks center Dwight Howard clearly does not know his own team’s name. “All right, let’s go, bird guys,” said Howard, who reportedly glanced furtively toward his teammates to gauge their reaction to one of his many wild guesses. “Come on, Red Beaks!

Man Tries Using Pink 6-Pound Bowling Ball To Great Amusement,"WEST ORANGE, NJ—Seemingly knowing full well that the relatively small and light ball was not designed for someone of his size, sources confirmed Tuesday that 25-year-old Darren Foerstner tried using a pink 6-pound bowling ball for one frame, all to the incredible amusement of friends and onlookers at Eagle Rock Lanes bowling alley. “When Darren walked up to the lane holding that little pink ball, we were all thinking, ‘Wait a minute, that ball is meant for children,’ but then we realized what he was doing, and everyone just started cracking up,” said friend Kelly Lingard, adding that, as part of his lighthearted and exceptionally entertaining display, Foerstner demonstrated that his thumb and fingers were unable to fit into the smaller holes of the pink ball, forcing him to palm it with his entire hand. “He told us he borrowed the ball from a 5-year-old girl, which was hilarious in and of itself, but then when he actually bowled with it, he wound up accidentally throwing it a few feet into the air, so it crashed really hard onto the lane before bouncing a few times and rolling into the gutter. It was very, very funny.” The spectacle reportedly then reached a hysterical climax after Foerstner attempted to throw the pink ball through his legs and inadvertently tossed it onto the wrong lane, prompting fits of joyous laughter from everyone present as he quickly apologized to the adjacent group of bowlers."

We sincerely look forward to Raider Nation joining us in Las Vegas.” Sources within the organization confirmed that the relocation package would be subsidized by a new amusement tax levied on those who remained in the city of Oakland.

Report: Delivering College Recruitment Letters To Five-Star Athletes Comprises 83% Of All Revenue For U.S. Postal Service,"WASHINGTON—Noting that almost two-thirds of the nation’s postal workers were occupied with sorting and delivering the packages at any given time, an audit released Thursday by the U.S. Postal Service revealed that delivering college recruitment letters to five-star athletes comprises 83 percent of the agency’s annual revenue. “Between high-gloss ‘Wanted’ posters depicting the player’s face, poster-sized mockups of athletes in a college team’s uniform, and handwritten notes from coaches emphasizing that the player is their missing piece to a national championship, correspondence from college athletics departments make up more than four out of every five deliveries from the Postal Service,” the report read in part, adding that the overwhelming majority of the nearly 500 million pieces of mail processed each day are part of universities’ efforts to recruit the nation’s approximately 50 best high school football and basketball players. “Of course, this figure also includes the millions of invitations to official campus visits and letters congratulating players on their recent high school playoff victory. In fact, throughout the month leading up to National Signing day, 97 percent of all overnight mail are letters from colleges to just six or seven still undecided recruits.” A recent analytics report released by Twitter also found that 68 percent of all direct messages are sent from assistant college coaches telling 15-year-old high school quarterbacks they could be the next Peyton Manning."

Goose Does Pretty Decent Job Shitting All Over High School Track,"ARDMORE, PA—Reflecting on the pride it takes in its craft, a local Canada goose confirmed Thursday that it had done a pretty decent job shitting all over the outdoor track at nearby Lower Merion High School. “I got up around 6 a.m. this morning and after an hour had managed to scatter my feces pretty evenly over the entire oval,” said the waterfowl, who after reportedly squeezing out dozens of tube-like turds over the 400-meter track then made quick work of the adjacent soccer field. “I was nervous because by the end I was starting to run low, but then some of my buddies came by and we completely blanketed the long-jump area in our excrement. I’ll tell you, it was a solid day’s work.” The goose added that after shitting its brains out for an entire morning, it barely had enough energy to aggressively honk at the track team throughout their two-hour practice."

He’s not hiding anywhere waiting to yell at you. I promise.” At press time, Caleb’s older brother was reportedly telling the 5-year-old that if he said the TV commentator’s name three times out loud, Skip Bayless would appear and take him."
NHL Commemorates 25th Anniversary Of First Ice Game,"NEW YORK—Celebrating one of the major turning points in the league’s long, storied history, the NHL commemorated the 25th anniversary of its first ice game Tuesday. “Twenty-five years ago, the idea of playing a game on ice was little more than a fun experiment to add some excitement to the season, and no one could have ever imagined it would take off like it did,” said NHL spokesperson Patrick Barnard, recalling the March 28, 1992 contest between the Montreal Canadiens and Pittsburgh Penguins played on a freshly frozen rink at the Civic Arena in front of a sellout crowd of 16,900 fans. “There was some initial resistance from the more conservative owners, but after that first game on ice proved to be such a huge hit with the fans, it became immediately clear the league had something special on its hands. By the end of the ’90s, most NHL teams were playing on ice, and it completely changed the way we think of hockey.” Barnard also expressed regret that no footage of the pre-ice era was preserved for posterity, as the NHL did not begin broadcasting games on television until 2011."
"‘Capital One Is A Terrible Bank,’ Says Charles Barkley In New Capital One Commercial","ATLANTA—Addressing the camera while seated on a couch between Samuel L. Jackson and Spike Lee, NBA legend and basketball analyst Charles Barkley declared that “Capital One is a terrible bank” in a new Capital One commercial that aired Thursday. “Capital One is a horrible company that screws over all of their customers, and nobody should use them,” said Barkley while eating a bowl of chips in front of a television broadcasting a basketball game, adding that he could probably think of at least ten banks viewers would be better off patronizing, even if they have poor credit. “They don’t listen to any complaints, they charge huge fees, and the financial advice you get from their experts is awful. They just want your money and don’t care about you at all. I fucking hate Capital One.” Barkley reportedly then turned to Lee and Jackson and informed them that he’s never worked with two bigger assholes."
Jim Nantz Wonders Aloud What Holding Basketball Like,"INDIANAPOLIS—Saying that he has always dreamed about the experience, CBS Sports announcer Jim Nantz reportedly wondered aloud what holding a basketball might be like during Friday afternoon’s broadcast. “It’s moments like this, as I watch these young players, that I imagine how truly amazing it must feel to hold a basketball,” said Nantz, marveling at the prospect of grabbing the basketball, lifting it over his head, or even gently spinning it in his hands. “A wave of emotion must course through your body while tracing your fingertips over those little bumps and the black lines on the ball. Gosh, it must be absolutely exhilarating for these young men when they finally get to hold a basketball. My heart is racing right now just thinking about it.” Nantz then reportedly turned to his broadcast partner Grant Hill and asked him to describe what it was like to hold a basketball during Duke’s appearance in the 1992 NCAA National Championship Game."
NCAA Tournament Really Disrupting Man’s Ability To Get Any Fucking Around Done,"CHICAGO—Calling the games a “complete time suck,” 32-year-old junior sales associate Collin Hiller told reporters Friday that the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament has really been affecting his ability to get any fucking around done. “Normally I’d be busy doing jack shit at the office right now, but today I’ve been completely distracted from that by all these games,” said Hiller, who had only intended for the tournament to serve as a brief break from aimlessly browsing YouTube, but instead spent the last three hours glued to the online broadcast at NCAA.com. “Christ, I’m so behind on checking out pictures of infinity pools, and there’s still a ton of crap to read on Twitter I haven’t even started yet. I want to catch the rest of this game, but I feel a little guilty not Gchatting with my girlfriend or just dicking around on my phone.” At press time, Hiller had simply resigned himself to pulling another all-nighter doing dumb shit."
Grayson Allen Recalls Struggle Growing Up Without Any Principles,"GREENVILLE, SC—Recounting the difficult circumstances that shaped his development into adulthood, Duke University shooting guard Grayson Allen recalled Friday the struggle of growing up without any principles. “It was really tough not having any ethics, especially when all the other kids did,” said a visibly distressed Allen, adding that it was always hard competing in basketball games when he was the only one on the team without any sense of right and wrong. “I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how it’s so unfair, but at some point I’ve just got to accept that I don’t have principles, and I never will. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that finding my way in the world without values was a blessing in disguise and made me into who I am as a person.” At press time, Allen told reporters that he would feel much worse about his lack of moral principles if it weren’t for coach Mike Krzyzewski’s unwavering support."
Shaq Wondering When People In Southern Hemisphere Have March Madness,"ATLANTA—Noting that things get “really messed up if you cross Earth’s middle,” Shaquille O’Neal reportedly wondered Tuesday when people in the Southern Hemisphere have March Madness. “I don’t think Australia or Tokyo have March Madness for another few months, because right now it’s October down there,” said O’Neal, adding that the regular season would likely continue until the end of November, which he claimed comes immediately before March in the “under parts.” “It’s probably pretty weird playing basketball down in the bottom places like Antarctica. The ball spins in the opposite direction, and I heard the possession arrow is flipped, too. It’s all backwards and stuff. Plus, after dunks you have to hang onto the rim so you don’t float away.” O’Neal then cautioned that players in other regions of the world must factor in the time zone difference when watching the shot clock.

Those guys are like my family.” At press time, Moore was reportedly overcome with emotion when the basketball team dedicated their season to him."
"Mother Of MMA Fighter Recalls Son Punching, Kicking Shit Out Of Everything From Early Age","SACRAMENTO, CA—Saying that his natural gifts were evident as soon as he started crawling, Jessica Enos, the mother of mixed martial arts fighter Cody Garbrandt, told reporters Thursday that her son began punching and kicking the shit out of everything from an early age. “Even as a baby, he was constantly whaling on his teddy bear with his fists and slamming the other stuffed animals up against the slats of his crib,” Enos said of the 25-year-old UFC bantamweight champion, adding that as a toddler he quickly developed a passion for sprinting across the living room and spearing his brother’s chest with his head. “Every time I turned around he was bashing his full body weight into the sofa or choking out one of the neighborhood kids in the backyard. Once he started going to school, the teachers all told me that he was clearly the best at roundhouse kicking his classmates in the face.” Enos then added that she would never forget the day she watched her son finally beat his dad in their driveway."
Benny The Bull Busted For Possession Of Unlicensed T-Shirt Gun,"CHICAGO—Noting that the suspect had been taken into custody after officers managed to tackle and wrestle the individual to the ground of the United Center concourse, police confirmed Monday that Chicago Bulls mascot Benny the Bull was arrested for possession of an unlicensed T-shirt gun. “The suspect was driving erratically on his motorcycle when we pulled him over to the side of the court, at which point we uncovered a weapon hidden on his person,” said Chicago police officer Isaac Guerrero, adding that Benny the Bull then fled from authorities on foot, eventually jumping off a trampoline, somersaulting through the air, and barreling through several cheerleaders who were blocking his path. “The suspect then began firing indiscriminately into the crowd before tossing the weapon into a trash can. Upon recovering the T-shirt gun it was clear the serial numbers had been filed off, and we later discovered over 300 rounds of T-shirts stockpiled in his storage locker.” In addition to the current weapons charges, officers said that Benny the Bull might face further prosecution if ballistic experts can successfully link the T-shirt gun to several unsolved shootings at the United Center."
 NFL Scouting Combine To Phase Out Subjecting Draft Prospects To Vivisection,"INDIANAPOLIS—Noting that the test’s significance has continued to wane ever since its debut in 1987, NFL officials announced Monday that the league’s scouting combine will phase out the process of subjecting draft prospects to vivisection. “While studying the internal organs of top draft prospects has long been one of the most anticipated and discussed elements of the combine, it is increasingly clear that teams no longer place enough value on these results to justify its inclusion in the evaluation process,” said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello, acknowledging that the test faced scrutiny after a string of several high-profile draft prospects failed to have any meaningful impact in the NFL despite impressing scouts with their cardiovascular systems, musculature, and bone strength during the live dissections. “Coaches and general managers have told us that they now see little correlation between such observations as the weight of a player’s lungs and their ability to produce on the field. We have also found that more players than ever before are choosing to forego their vivisection at the combine rather than risk damaging their draft stock, making the decision to eliminate the assessment a fairly easy one.” The NFL also confirmed that, with the termination of the test this year, Mark Sanchez would remain the only player to have achieved a perfect score on his combine vivisection in 2009."

Now, my dearest Timothy, what have you heard of the Browns’ plans to address their quarterback situation?” According to sources, Schefter was unable to confirm whether Roger Goodell would alter celebration penalties after learning the orphan dispatched to find out had been captured and locked in the commissioner’s office cupboard.

New NHL Promotion Allows Fans To Watch Game While Frozen Underneath Ice,"NEW YORK—Promising to provide an exciting up-close and frigid viewing experience, the NHL unveiled a new promotion Thursday offering fans the chance to watch games while frozen underneath the arena ice. “Throughout the month of March, fans in all 30 NHL cities will have the opportunity to sit just inches away from all the heart-pounding hockey action taking place directly above them on the ice,” said NHL vice president of marketing Brian Jennings, adding that, as part of the promotion, paying customers must arrive five hours before the faceoff in order to lie down atop the concrete slab before a layer of ice is installed on all sides of their bodies. “General seating will be available between both blue lines, while premium ticket-holders can be frozen in place right in the heart of the attacking zone. Whether it’s bone-crushing checks or clutch saves, fans can catch it all at 16 degrees Fahrenheit.” Jennings added that the NHL strongly encourages all participants to wait to regain feeling in their extremities before attempting to drive home after the game."
Kid Coming From P.E. Spends Entire Math Class Absolutely Drenched In Sweat,"TRENTON, NJ—Having arrived directly from the school gym where he played three-on-three basketball for 45 minutes, local 10th-grader Alex McKean reportedly spent the entirety of his math class Tuesday absolutely drenched in sweat. Early reports confirmed that the 15-year-old, who first entered the classroom with his sweat-stained T-shirt clinging to his body, immediately sprawled out on a chair in the back row, with beads of perspiration continuing to stream down his forehead, neck, and arms. Completely flushed in the face, the high schooler could also be heard panting heavily well into the first five minutes of the lesson as he tugged repeatedly at the front of his shirt in an effort to cool himself down. In addition to leaving all students in his vicinity visibly disgusted, McKean’s powerful body odor reportedly deterred his teacher from walking anywhere near his section of the classroom for the duration of the lecture. Following the bell, sources confirmed that McKean made a quick stop at a water fountain before showing up to his American history class with water still dripping from his mouth."
Blake Griffin Claims Basketball Seems Much Rounder Lately,"LOS ANGELES—Sharing the observation with teammates and coaches, Clippers power forward Blake Griffin reportedly insisted on several occasions Monday that the NBA official game basketball seems much rounder lately. “Now, whenever I touch the ball, it definitely feels way more curvier,” said Griffin, who appeared lost in thought while slowly running his fingers along the basketball’s surface before declaring that the object looked “extra spherical.” “Maybe they started putting in super-strong circles when they make the basketballs, because I swear right now there’s a whole lot more roundness.” At press time, Griffin had reportedly concluded that the basketball was probably pregnant."

Key Halftime Adjustments Propel Fourth-Grade Rec Basketball Team To 8-Point Third Quarter,"WARREN, MI—Completing a stunning turnaround after the opposing team had jumped out to a commanding two-score lead, a local fourth-grade recreational basketball team made several key halftime adjustments Wednesday night that propelled them to a dominant eight-point third quarter. “We had a rough start, but deciding to put the ball in [guard Michael] Higgins’ hands really paid off when he absolutely caught fire by going two-of-nine in the second half,” said coach Jeff Hornyak, who also credited the addition of a second play for the team’s offensive explosion of four unanswered points over the first seven minutes of the third quarter. “Of course, Tyler [Guertner] also came up huge with a two-pointer after we told him to concentrate on using the backboard to bank in layups instead of launching airballs from several feet behind the three-point line, and our renewed emphasis on getting to the foul line worked out perfectly once we finally sank one. This was easily the most impressive game I’ve seen from these guys all year.” While pleased with his team’s offensive firepower, Hornyak added that none of it would have been possible without 5-foot-tall center Patrick Clark’s 37 rebounds."
NBA Fan Still Hasn’t Gotten Used To Seeing Zaza Pachulia In A Warriors Uniform,"NEW YORK—Saying that he is thrown for a loop every time he sees the player this season, local 29-year-old NBA fan Jon Westmoreland admitted to reporters Tuesday that he still hasn’t become accustomed to the sight of veteran center Zaza Pachulia in a Golden State Warriors uniform. “It just doesn’t look right, seeing Zaza in that blue-and-gold jersey with the Warriors logo on his chest,” said Westmoreland, adding that after years of watching the Georgian big man play for the Magic, Bucks, Hawks, and Mavericks, it’s strange to see Pachulia wearing anything other than an electric-blue, green, red-and-black, or royal-blue uniform. “I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to it. I wish he had just stayed in Orlando, Atlanta, Milwaukee, or Dallas.” Westmoreland added that he believes Pachulia “sold out” when the center decided to join forces with Warriors stars Kevon Looney, Ian Clark, and Patrick McCaw."
Pickup Football Pioneer Credited With Idea For ‘5 Mississippi’ Blitz Count Dead At 94,"CHATTANOOGA, TN—Hailing him as a revolutionary figure who forever changed the way the game was played, sources confirmed Friday that Art Folson, the pickup football pioneer credited with introducing the famed “Five Mississippi” blitz count, has passed away at the age of 94. “Art was a true visionary, and his innovative idea to prohibit defenders from rushing the quarterback until they said ‘Mississippi’ five times succeeded in increasing scoring and encouraged the development of more complex defenses,” said former teammate Norman McBride, 90, adding that Folson’s numerous other contributions, such as allowing the quarterback to start each play with the ball in his hands and proposing that two completions equaled a first down, guided the sport through its uncertain formative years. “Of course, without Art’s suggestion that we simply throw the ball to the other team on kickoffs, pickup football teams might still be punting balls wildly out of bounds after every single touchdown. He was one of the game’s most brilliant minds, and his legacy will forever live on in the countless pickup football games played across this country every single day.” Family members confirmed that Folson will be buried in his trademark blue sweatshirt that was the first to ever be used to mark the boundary of an end zone."
Gary Bettman Issues Pardon For Steve Yzerman’s 1997 Slashing Penalty,"NEW YORK—Acknowledging that the referee’s original ruling represented a grave miscarriage of justice, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman issued an official pardon Thursday to former Detroit Red Wings center Steve Yzerman for his 1997 slashing penalty against the Phoenix Coyotes. “Today’s decision to clear Mr. Yzerman of any wrongdoing in this incident is an important reminder that while our league’s penalty system is not perfect, it is never too late to correct our mistakes,” Bettman said during a press conference, adding that Yzerman’s exoneration was prompted by the discovery of new video evidence confirming that the 10-time All-Star never actually struck Coyotes left winger Keith Tkachuk’s stick in the second period of the January 9, 1997 regular-season game. “While Mr. Yzerman will never get back the two minutes he served in the penalty box, we can amend the record to reflect his innocence and restore his good name. It is my sincere hope that this will finally begin the healing process for him and his loved ones.” League sources confirmed, however, that Bettman plans to deny former Montreal Canadiens center Jean Beliveau a posthumous pardon for a controversial 1970 tripping incident despite a widespread petition started by the deceased Hall of Famer’s family."

Although some of this is [host] Carl [Donovan]’s fault—why would you put out the football-shaped cookies before nachos? Ugh, I never should have munched on the nut mix for the entire first quarter with all these much better snacks still to come. I messed up big time.” At press time, Simmons expressed frustration that he was “way too stuffed” to finish his third beer. "

What Mabel did today will certainly have folks talking on Monday.” The incident comes one year after Mabel was fined five chew toys for wearing a neon-colored, non-Animal-Planet-approved collar during Puppy Bowl XII."
NFL Loses Rights To ‘Super Bowl’,"NEW YORK—After failing to agree to terms for a new licensing agreement before the February 3 deadline, the NFL lost the rights to the term “Super Bowl” on Friday, sources confirmed. “As of today, the National Football League will no longer have a claim to merchandising, marketing, or any other use of the ‘Super Bowl’ brand,” said industry expert Jason Galecki of the American Marketing Association, noting that in light of its decision to relinquish the name, the league has been forced to modify the stadium logos, game jerseys, and even commemorative T-shirts for the upcoming championship to reflect the new title, “Big Game 51.” “By letting its ownership of ‘Super Bowl’ expire, the NFL has also lost all associated terms, including ‘Lombardi Trophy,’ which will now be known as the ‘Tagliabue Cup.’ Should the league ever choose to mention the name ‘Super Bowl’ in the future, it may be subject to litigation for trademark infringement.” At press time, sources confirmed that the rights to the name “Super Bowl” had been quickly purchased by PepsiCo for $25 billion."

NFL Adds Passing Concussion Protocol To Pro Bowl Skills Competition,"ORLANDO, FL—Promising to highlight the incredible talents of the biggest names in football, the NFL announced Thursday that passing the concussion protocol has been added as a competition in this year’s Pro Bowl Skills Showdown. “I am excited to announce that for the first time ever, six All-Stars from the AFC and NFC will compete against one another to prove who can convincingly pass the league’s sideline neurological exam after incurring a concussion,” said league commissioner Roger Goodell, noting that in addition to quizzing concussed participants on their name and current location, the televised contest will feature a team of medical professionals measuring which players can most accurately recite the months of the year in reverse order while suppressing nausea and any visible signs of disorientation. “Over the course of the season, these athletes have showcased their amazing ability to score sufficiently on reflex and balance tests in order to be cleared to return to the playing field, and tonight, fans will have the opportunity to finally watch them compete head to head. This will truly pit the best against the best.” Goodell added that the concussion protocol challenge will conclude with a special NFL alumni matchup between Hall of Fame quarterbacks Troy Aikman and Steve Young."
Roger Goodell Announces New Contest Offering NFL Fans Chance To Present Lombardi Trophy To Super Bowl–Winning Team,"NEW YORK—As part of the build-up to the highly anticipated matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced a new contest Wednesday offering fans the chance to present the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the winning team of Super Bowl LI. “This year, for the first time ever, one lucky fan will get the opportunity to go down onto the field after the game and hand the famed Lombardi Trophy to the head coach and owner of the Super Bowl champions,” said Goodell, adding that the randomly drawn winner would get to personally congratulate the team on the trophy presentation stage in front of over 70,000 fans at NRG Stadium and an estimated 160 million people watching on television around the world. “Not only will they pose for photographs while holding the Lombardi Trophy alongside the winning team’s ownership, but they will also get to shake hands with the player selected as Super Bowl MVP. I couldn’t be more excited to make one fan’s dream come true on Super Bowl Sunday.” Goodell added that in order to provide “the ultimate Super Bowl experience,” he will generously allow the contest winner to sit in the commissioner’s seat during the game while he watches it from home"
NFL Geneticists Working On Developing Ligament-Free Player,"NEW YORK—Noting that the effort represents the future of professional football, league officials announced Monday that NFL geneticists are working to develop a completely ligament-free player. “We’re confident that in the near future, we will have elite NFL players without any connective tissue forming joints between their bones,” said NFL chief genomics researcher Edwin Davis, adding that the league’s ambitious $400 million research initiative aims to end such debilitating injuries as ACL and MCL tears by completely removing all ligaments from the human body. “Our initial trials have been quite promising, and our test subjects should eventually be able to run routes, throw, and catch, all while their bones are allowed to freely move or violently twist in any and all directions. Our hope is that this research will lead to both ligament- and tendon-free players by the 2040 season, but it’s still very early in the research process.” Davis added that he is also incredibly optimistic about the progress being made toward developing a concussion-proof player whose brain has no cognitive functions whatsoever."
Patriots Not Allowing Football Game Against Texans To Become Distraction,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Insisting that it is the furthest thing from their minds at this point in their season, members of the New England Patriots told reporters Thursday that they are not allowing their upcoming game against the Houston Texans to become a distraction. “Obviously, it’s something we’d rather not be dealing with right now, but we’re not going to let trivial stuff like this Saturday’s matchup with the Texans take away our focus from our goals as a team,” said Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who downplayed the upcoming divisional playoff game by adding that players and coaches have avoided discussing the subject at all in the locker room. “We know it’s something that the media wants to make a big deal of, but it’s getting blown out of proportion, and honestly, none of us are paying any attention to it. It’s not something we’re going to waste time worrying about.” Sources confirmed that a visibly frustrated Brady later stormed out of the press conference after refusing to answer yet another question about facing Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler."
NFL To Curb Excessive Celebrations By Removing Areas Of Players’ Brains Responsible For Emotions,"NEW YORK—Stressing that the league will take a hard-line stance when enforcing its policy for on-field conduct, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced plans Thursday to curb any prolonged or excessive touchdown celebrations by removing the areas of players’ brains responsible for emotions. “In order to prevent any future incidents of unsportsmanlike behavior, we will be forcing every player to undergo a roughly 14-hour surgical procedure that will remove all parts of the cerebrum that correspond to experiencing feelings of any kind,” said Goodell, adding that in order to comply with rules regarding acceptable celebrations, players will no longer be permitted to possess the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, or cingulate gyrus in their limbic systems beginning in week 15 of the regular season. “We’re confident that by surgically excising the neurological structures that allow players to feel joy, excitement, relief, pleasure, or any other emotion, our athletes will conduct themselves properly and represent their teams, the league, and the sport of football in the best manner possible.” At press time, the Pittsburgh Steelers confirmed that due to a serious surgical complication, star wide receiver Antonio Brown has been left in a permanent vegetative state."
Report: Look How Big Player Is Next To Sideline Reporter,"GREEN BAY, WI—Marveling at the pronounced disparity in size during the postgame interview, sources confirmed Sunday that, Jesus Christ, just look at how big Houston Texans nose tackle Vince Wilfork is next to the CBS sideline reporter. “Holy shit, she looks like a 5-year-old standing next to him,” 29-year-old viewer Brad Murray said as Wilfork’s massive frame absolutely towered over the reporter, who conducted the interview normally as though she wasn’t alongside someone literally three times her size. “He has to lean all the way down just to speak into her microphone. She looks like she’s about average height, too, but she’d probably die if he accidentally fell on her.” At press time, Murray felt a sudden surge of terror after imagining someone of Wilfork’s size trying to hit him as hard as he could during a football game."
NFL Announcer Better Hurry The Fuck Up Congratulating Producer On New Baby And Get Back To Game,"GREEN BAY, WI—Noting with urgency that play was about to resume after a brief timeout on the field, sources confirmed Sunday that CBS announcer Jim Nantz better hurry the fuck up congratulating one of the broadcast’s producers on his new baby and get back to the Packers-Texans game. “Okay, he had a baby—good for him—but there’s a football game happening right now that I’d like to actually watch,” said 33-year-old viewer Chuck Prescott of Beaumont, TX, adding that Nantz and commentator Phil Simms had already wasted enough goddamn time showing pictures of the longtime producer’s newborn daughter onscreen as they welcomed “the newest member of the CBS Sports family.” “I can still hear the crowd in the background, so they need to get their asses in gear and put the game back on, because I better not miss a big play for this shit. Why couldn’t they have just done this at halftime?” At press time, the Packers had converted on third-and-long while Nantz and Simms were droning on about their support and best wishes for some fucking sound technician who is currently undergoing treatment for cancer."
"‘You Hate To See That,’ Announces Fan Secretly Thrilled About Rival Player’s Injury","BALTIMORE—Wincing and shaking his head at the sight of trainers assisting the opposing team’s running back off the field, 34-year-old Baltimore Ravens fan Bobby Ferrara announced Sunday that “you hate to see that” while secretly feeling thrilled about the injury. “Oh man, I hope he’s okay—you never want someone to have to leave the game like that,” said Ferrara, who privately experienced a mixture of immense relief and elation over the fact that the other team’s greatest scoring threat would be immediately replaced by his rookie backup, likely forcing their offense to become one-dimensional. “He’s such a great player. Hopefully it’s nothing serious.” At press time, Ferrara’s heart had reportedly sunk as he muttered “Good to hear” upon learning the star back would be returning in time for the fourth quarter."
Penn State Staff Unsure What To Do With Breathtakingly Innovative Defensive Playbooks Jerry Sandusky Keeps Sending Them,"STATE COLLEGE, PA—Members of the Penn State football coaching staff revealed to reporters Friday that they have no idea what to do with the unbelievably innovative defensive playbooks former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky continues to send them on a regular basis.Sandusky, who is currently serving a 30-to-60-year prison sentence after being found guilty of sexually abusing young boys over the span of decades while coaching at Penn State, has reportedly mailed the Nittany Lions an extensive library of defensive schemes, formations, and plays that the team’s current coaches reluctantly admitted are “absolutely groundbreaking” and “virtually unstoppable.”"
Cleveland Indians Worried Team Cursed After Building Franchise On Old Native American Stereotype,"CLEVELAND—Having watched in horror as their team crumbled after a 3-1 World Series lead, members of the Cleveland Indians expressed concern Thursday that the organization has been cursed for building their franchise on an incredibly old Native American stereotype. “Everyone always warned us that we shouldn’t build a team on this archaic American Indian caricature, but we didn’t listen,” said Indians part-owner Paul Dolan, adding that using the centuries-old stereotype as the foundation for the franchise’s identity clearly provoked the wrath of some ancient evil, which has caused the team to suffer decades of pain and hardship ever since. “All this bad luck can’t just be a coincidence—if only we’d fully comprehended the consequences of trying to make money off this cheap stereotype. We should move away from this awful Native American misappropriation and never look back.” At press time, Dolan was shrieking as large boils began spreading all over his body after he dug up the team’s logo from the 1940s."
Millions Of Drunk Cubs Fans Rioting In Heaven Following World Series Win,"THE HEAVENS—Following a 8-7 victory over the Cleveland Indians that clinched the team’s first World Series title since 1908, sources confirmed Wednesday that millions of intoxicated Chicago Cubs fans are currently rioting across Heaven.Moments after watching the game’s final out from above Earth, massive throngs of intoxicated Cubs fans—most of whom went their entire lives without ever seeing the team win a World Series—poured out all over the eternal city, where they reportedly continued drinking heavily as they cheered, hugged strangers, and loudly played golden harps in celebration of their long-awaited championship."
NBA Heads To Northeast Farms For Annual Basketball Picking,"SOMERS, CT—Taking part in the popular autumn tradition, players, coaches, and owners from across the NBA reportedly traveled to several Connecticut farms Friday to pick basketballs. “This is the perfect time of year to walk around a basketball patch with your team and choose a few big orange Spaldings to bring home,” league commissioner Adam Silver told reporters as players excitedly picked up various basketballs to check if they were solid and fully inflated. “The air is crisp, the leaves have changed colors, and basketballs are ripe and regulation-size. The farms up here have a great selection of basketballs that will last the whole regular season before they start rotting, and it’s always nice to see the smiles on the younger rookies while they walk around hugging their freshly picked basketballs with both hands.” Silver added that he usually brings a few of the smaller, oddly colored basketballs back with him to donate to the WNBA."
Cubs Fan Ready To Get Completely Drunk Again On Only 2 Days’ Rest,"CHICAGO—Explaining that he is breaking from his normal routine for Game 1 of the World Series, 32-year-old Chicago Cubs fan Frank Sanford confirmed Tuesday that he feels ready to get completely drunk again on only two days’ rest. “I usually need at least four or five days off between getting blackout drunk, but it’s the World Series, so I’ll do whatever I have to do to get out there and get absolutely wasted tonight,” said Sanford, adding that he used Sunday and Monday to rest and recover following his 12-beer outing during the Cubs’ NLCS-clinching win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday. “I did some light drinking yesterday and felt okay, so I think I’ll be good to go. I might not be able to drink as much as I normally could after a full week’s rest, but I’ll go hard and throw back as many beers as I can. There’s no way I would miss an opportunity to get totally hammered when my team is in the World Series.” Sanford added that he is hoping to avoid a repeat of Game 4 of the 2015 NLCS, when he was taken out of the bar by his friends after throwing up twice on just eight shots in the first four innings."
Jumbotron Really Trying To Push New Third-Down Cheer On Fans,"SAN DIEGO—Noting that the phrase had appeared in large blue letters during each of the team’s offensive drives, sources at Qualcomm Stadium confirmed Friday that the Jumbotron was trying really hard to push a new third-down cheer on San Diego Chargers fans. “The phrase ‘Let’s Go Bolts!’ just randomly appeared on the screen while pounding drums played over the loudspeakers—I’ve been going to Chargers games my entire life, and I’ve never heard anyone say that once,” said 39-year-old spectator Joseph Novello, who estimated that less than 10 percent of the confused crowd joined in on the cheer, most of whom were children. “Each word gets bigger on the screen when you’re supposed to yell it, like they’re trying to teach us the cheer or something. Honestly, everybody is just doing their best to ignore it at this point.” Fans were said to be relieved later in the game when the familiar plea to “Get Charged Up!” finally appeared on the Jumbotron."
Retired David Ortiz Excited To Finally Eat Whatever He Wants,"BOSTON—Having officially entered retirement after 20 seasons in Major League Baseball, former Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz told reporters Thursday that he is excited to finally be able to eat whatever he wants. “Man, my whole career I had to stay down to between 250 and 260 pounds for the team, so it’ll be good to just let loose and go back up to my natural body weight,” said Ortiz, adding that with his playing days behind him, he no longer needs to worry about limiting himself to only two sausage pizzas and one 42-ounce party-size bag of “peanut butter N&M’s [sic]” for his usual afternoon snack. “I was starving having just a 20-egg omelet for breakfast every morning during the season, and even then it was really hard to fit into my uniform’s 46-inch waist. Now, I can eat as many lunches as I want without any of the coaches getting mad and yelling at me.” The 10-time MLB All-Star added that he also will not miss his mandatory 0.01-mile run every other Sunday."
Michelle Obama Throws Out A Bunch Of Barack’s Old Number 44 Jerseys,"WASHINGTON—Using a large plastic trash bag to collect the uniforms scattered around their bedroom closet, Michelle Obama reportedly spent Wednesday afternoon throwing out many of her husband’s old number 44 jerseys. “These things are just taking up space, and I’ve never seen Barack wear this Lakers jersey anyway,” said the first lady, adding that she found a rumpled pile of her husband’s personalized San Francisco Giants and University of Alabama Crimson Tide uniforms lying in the corner. “I know he likes to wear this Spurs one when he plays basketball, but the rest are just sitting here collecting dust, and his name is starting to come off the back of some of them. I’ll just drop them off at Goodwill or something.” At press time, a panicked President Obama was frantically rummaging around the closet and demanding to know what happened to his lucky Minnesota Lynx jersey."
MLB Mascots Union Demands More Bald Fans To Playfully Tease Between Innings,"NEW YORK—Threatening to strike next season unless their conditions were immediately met, the MLB mascots union issued a statement Monday demanding more bald fans to playfully tease between innings. “We ask Commissioner Rob Manfred and the MLB organization to guarantee that going forward, our stadiums feature at least double the number of bald fans whom we can rib in a light-hearted fashion during game breaks by polishing their heads as though they were bowling balls,” read a statement signed by all 35 members of the Major League Baseball Mascots Association, which went on to stress that their terms are “non-negotiable.” “If the league fails to provide a significant increase of middle-aged, preferably chubby men whose bald heads we can pretend to use as a mirror with which to admire our reflections, we will have no choice but to refuse to sign a new collective bargaining agreement. Furthermore, until our demands are met, all members of our organization will cease pulling up fans to dance with on top of the dugout, stealing the hats of umpires, or leaning in for a kiss on the cheek from a woman in the stands. We warn you: Do not test our resolve in this matter.” At press time, Chicago police had reportedly been called after a physical altercation had broken out between Wrigley Field security and a group of protesters led by Mr. Met, Billy the Marlin, and the Milwaukee Brewers’ Racing Sausages."
Disturbing MLB Postseason Commercial Claims October Is When The Maggots Feast On Rotting Pig Flesh,"NEW YORK—Featuring various clips from past playoff games and what appears to be an abandoned slaughterhouse, a disturbing new MLB postseason commercial that began airing Friday claims October is when the maggots feast on rotting pig flesh. “October: when the best in baseball go head-to-head, when true champions rise above, when worms gorge themselves on befouled meat of the filthy swine,” the commercial’s narrator says as footage of Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner delivering a fastball and Cubs slugger Kris Bryant sliding into home plate slowly fade to a close-up of larvae infesting a dead pig’s exposed entrails and horseflies swarming the eyeball of a decomposing boar carcass. “The maggots will bloat as they feed, pulsating in a symphony of decay and ruin. A corrosive stench will burn the air and poison the lungs. And when the pig blood is drained and the vermin scatter, Earth will reclaim the naked, desiccated bones. This is October.” The ad then concludes with the narrator instructing viewers to “Catch the postseason on Fox and TBS” as the MLB logo is superimposed over a pile of severed pig heads."
Wade Phillips Spends Game In Front Of Sideline Mist Machine With Mouth Open,"TAMPA, FL—Holding his tongue out while standing several inches away from the device, Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips reportedly spent most of Sunday’s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in front of the team’s sideline mist machine with his mouth open. “Mmm, that hits the spot,” said Phillips, who at one point stopped several defensive players from sitting down in front of the machine, saying that he was “not done drinking yet.” “I always get really thirsty during games, so this is perfect. Can you believe they give us all this tasty air water for free?” At press time, Phillips was shuffling side to side in order to follow the stream of mist as the machine oscillated."
"Teammate Actually Trying To Do Homework During 30-Minute Period Between School, Practice","CHADDS FORD, PA—Watching in disbelief as she pulled out a textbook in the midst of the busy locker room, members of the Unionville High School field hockey team told reporters Thursday that sophomore forward Kelly Wilcox was actually trying to do some homework during the 30-minute period between school and the start of practice. “She’s sitting there with some bio worksheet on her lap that she’s rushing to finish, but what the hell does she think she’s going to accomplish in the next half hour?” said junior defender Katie Fitzgerald, adding that Wilcox, who changed into her practice clothes faster than anyone else on the team, was somehow tuning out the din of other girls talking and slamming lockers shut as she flipped through her textbook in search of answers to her homework questions. “You need a little time to grab your field hockey stuff and head to the locker room after ninth period lets out, and then it takes at least 15 minutes to change and walk over to the field, so she’s only got about 10 minutes, max, to get any work done. Why even bother?” At press time, locker room sources confirmed that, holy shit, it looked like Wilcox"
Rest Of Nation To Penn State: ‘Something Is Very Wrong With All Of You’,"WASHINGTON—Stating they felt deeply unnerved by the community’s unwavering and impassioned defense of a football program and administration that enabled child sexual abuse over the course of several decades, the rest of the country informed Penn State University Friday that there is clearly something very wrong with all of them.The nation’s nearly 320 million citizens all confirmed that the Penn State community’s repeated denials of the school’s culpability, continued displays of reverence for their former football head coach Joe Paterno, and failure to meaningfully acknowledge and respect the victims suggest that they share a very warped perspective on the world and may indeed be suffering from some kind of serious mental health condition."
Soccer Players Under Impression High School’s Football Rivalries Extend To Them Too,"GLEN ROCK, NJ—Stressing that everyone is counting on them to win what they incorrectly assume to be one of the biggest games of the year, the Glen Rock Panthers soccer team is evidently under the impression that their high school’s football rivalries extend to them as well, sources confirmed Thursday. “We hate the [Lawrenceville High School] Knights and they hate us, so losing against them isn’t an option,” senior defender Nick Freeman said of the upcoming soccer match, which virtually no other student in the school is aware of and which, unlike the heated annual Friday night football game between the two schools, is scheduled for 4 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon. “People were really pissed when they beat us in the playoffs last year, so this is going to be payback. The games between us are always heated, and it’ll probably get pretty physical out there, but if you can’t psych yourself up for a game against the Knights, then you shouldn’t be out on the field.” At press time, the game had reportedly kicked off with a total of eight spectators watching from the sideline."
Deion Sanders Recalls Starting Out As NFL Network Researcher,"CULVER CITY, CA—Reflecting on how far he has come in his career, football analyst Deion Sanders told reporters Wednesday about his experience starting out at the NFL Network as a researcher. “It wasn’t easy to start at the bottom like that—there were plenty of late nights in the stacks compiling passing stats for every team and combing through player bios for facts to use in the broadcast,” said Sanders, adding that after joining the network in 2006, he worked for nearly two and a half years in an entry-level role before being promoted to segment producer, which eventually led to an audition for an on-air role. “If you screwed something up, or didn’t have the research packets organized and color-coded the way Rich [Eisen] and the other guys liked it, you’d never hear the end of it from the executive producers. I sure didn’t love getting coffee for Brian Billick and Steve Mariucci every morning, or pulling footage from old games to use for pregame highlights, but that’s how I cut my teeth here.” Sanders added that he is incredibly grateful to have gotten the chance to advance at the network and isn’t still stuck working as a production assistant like Curtis Martin."
"Backstory Probably Explains Why Sports Bar Has Orioles, Lakers, Bears Flags","HOUSTON—Confused by the seemingly unrelated collection of team decor throughout the establishment, patrons of Miller’s Ale House speculated Thursday that a backstory probably exists to explain the Baltimore Orioles, Los Angeles Lakers, and Chicago Bears flags hanging outside the sports bar. “Well, maybe the owner was originally from Baltimore and grew up watching the Orioles, and if his parents were from Chicago, he might have become a Bears fan because of them,” said 29-year-old Frank Hartwell, adding that some logical, yet-to-be-determined reason must account for a signed and framed Kobe Bryant jersey hanging next to a Chicago Tribune front page celebrating the Bears’ 1985 Super Bowl win inside a Houston bar. “I guess there could be multiple owners, and if one of them is from L.A., but doesn’t like baseball, that’d be why there isn’t any Dodgers or Angels stuff. There’s also this one University of Tennessee Vols pennant at the back of the bar, and I have no idea what that’s about. I’m sure there’s a reasonable explanation for all this.” At press time, the clientele had given up trying to figure out the bar’s backstory after noticing multiple signed photos of former Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stieb hanging outside the bathrooms."
Handmade Banner That Football Team Runs Through Before Game The Closest High School Comes To Supporting Arts,"PINE BLUFF, AK—Featuring a consistent budget and students regularly encouraged to take part in its construction, a 6-foot-by-12-foot handmade banner that the Pine Bluff High School football team runs through before every game represents the closest thing the school comes to supporting the arts, sources confirmed Friday. The banner, which is held up by several cheerleaders before players tear it in half while sprinting onto the field, is reportedly the most routinely supported school-sponsored outlet for students interested in exploring the arts and expressing themselves creatively. Those familiar with the situation confirmed that an $85 weekly allocation for poster paper, colored markers, acrylic paint, and glitter glue consists of the most resources Pine Bluff pours into the visual arts, music, theater, creative writing, or dance, while the cheerleading coach’s supervision of the banner’s design accounts for the most time anyone employed by the district spends on cultivating the artistic talents of its students. The banner’s hand-drawn ram mascot and carefully lettered rallying cry of “Cage The Lions!” in reference to the team’s opponent is also said to have received the greatest amount of attention from administrators and the local community of any recent student-made artistic endeavor. At press time, sources confirmed that school officials ensuring the banner paper can be easily ripped is also the highest level of concern they ever show for the football players’ safety."

"Family At Beach Apparently Brought, Set Up Own Volleyball Net","EAST ORLEANS, MA—Noting that they evidently found it to be a worthwhile and necessary item to take with them, reports confirmed Wednesday that a family at Nauset Beach brought and set up their own volleyball net. “It looks like these people were willing to pack up this big cardboard box of metal poles, lug it all the way from where they parked, and then walk all the way down the beach to find a spot large enough to fit an entire court,” said local beachgoer Josh Ramsey, adding that the family spent roughly 30 minutes unfurling the tangled net, assembling the poles, and anchoring support ropes into the sand. “There are only five of them, so they probably could have had just as much fun hitting a volleyball around while standing in a circle. Besides, who buys a volleyball net? Do they really play volleyball enough to need their own net?” At press time, the family had played volleyball for roughly 20 minutes before abandoning the game entirely and heading into the water."
Former WWE Wrestler Found Alive At 44,"PHOENIX—In a revelation that has sent shockwaves through the wrestling world, sources confirmed that former WWE wrestler Freddy Hendricks, better known as his in-ring persona “Time Bomb,” was discovered alive Friday at the age of 44.Hendricks, who wrestled in the WWE from 1993 to 2005, was reported to be conscious and breathing at his one-bedroom apartment at approximately 4:45 in the afternoon. According to those close to the situation, the news came as a complete surprise to friends and family of the popular retired performer.“I hadn’t seen Freddy in a while, and when I dropped by his place, I found him sprawled out on the couch, and I could immediately see that he was moving,” said former WWE wrestler and longtime friend Jeff Hardy. “Seeing his body lying there, just alive like that—I didn’t even know how to react. I was stunned.”"
Study: 96% Of Pickup Games Decided By Next Score,"PRINCETON, NJ—Noting that none of the game’s earlier events factored into the final outcome in any way whatsoever, a study released Wednesday by researchers at Princeton University revealed that 96 percent of all pickup games are decided by the next score. “We examined more than 1,000 games over the past five years and found that in the overwhelming majority of cases—be it pickup basketball, football, hockey, or soccer—the next team to score wins,” said study co-author Amy Lakin, adding that pickup outings frequently switch to a sudden-death format as soon as one of the players observes that it’s getting too dark out or that the energy of both teams has drastically diminished over the past 10 minutes. “Oftentimes—in roughly 80 percent of instances—the person to suggest that the next score wins is visibly tired and out of breath. We also found that the decisive nature of the game’s conclusion is almost always posed by the team that had given up the previous basket, touchdown, or goal, which is also generally the same team that would have been losing by a wide margin had anyone been keeping reliable track of the score.” Lakin added that although most players agree to call it a night following the next score, a caveat is often added that requires teams to win by two, ultimately prolonging each game by an average of 40 minutes."
Mom To Boil Mouthguard Just For Herself For A Change,"MASON, MI—Admitting that she doesn’t often get the chance to indulge herself, local mother of three Beth Everson announced plans Tuesday to boil a mouthguard just for herself for a change. “It feels like I’m always boiling a mouthguard for one of my kids, so for once, I’m going to set aside some free time to boil one for me,” said the 46-year-old, adding that with her adolescent sons playing both football and lacrosse, she rarely gets the opportunity to submerge a mouthguard into a bowl of boiling water in order to fit the rubber to her own teeth. “Don’t get me wrong, I love boiling mouthguards for my boys. But every now and then, I could really use an afternoon to just boil a nice mouthguard and then bite down on it myself for 30 or 40 seconds.” At press time, a contented Everson was quietly reading in the family’s living room while wearing a new mouthguard."
Pretty Decent 13th Birthday Party Taking Place At Week 3 Preseason Game,"EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ—Excitedly watching the exhibition game in the half-empty stadium, local 13-year-old Josh McNeil reportedly had an overall pretty decent birthday party Saturday night at a Week 3 preseason NFL game between the New York Giants and the New York Jets. “I’ve never been to a game, and my dad said I could only take two of my friends, so Jeremy and Michael came with us, and we actually got to sit in one of the middle levels,” said McNeil, adding that after moving down a few rows to a set of unoccupied seats, his father purchased the boys and McNeil’s two sisters several baskets of chicken fingers to split as they watched the brief first-quarter appearances of Giants quarterback Eli Manning and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. “It was still cool watching a game in person even if it didn’t count for anything. We had to leave during the third quarter because it was getting late and Jeremy had soccer practice in the morning. It was, you know…it was fun.” Sources confirmed that McNeil’s party was almost as good as his birthday two years ago when he and several friends attended an MLS game at Red Bull Arena."
Nation Feels Terrible For Wife Of Little League World Series Coach,"SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, PA—Expressing sorrow at the mere thought of what she has to endure, Americans across the nation confirmed Thursday that they feel absolutely terrible for the wife of a Little League World Series coach. “God, that poor woman—her entire life revolves around 12-year-olds playing baseball,” said 29-year-old Sacramento, CA resident Pat Walsh, adding that the middle-aged woman must know full well that she is being shown on national television wearing the hat and replica jersey of a Little League baseball team while she sits in the stands. “She has to put up with her husband talking about Little League all day, not to mention the fact that he’ll probably continue coaching even after their son is no longer on the team, so she’ll have to deal with this for years. Jesus.” The American public later admitted to feeling even worse for the coach’s daughter, who is clearly forced to attend the Little League World Series against her will."
Dad Thinks Son Has What It Takes To Become Embittered Alcoholic Minor League Journeyman,"NORMAN, OK—Watching the 11-year-old play shortstop for his Little League team, local father Mark Garrett reported Wednesday that he thinks his son, Nathan, has what it takes to become an embittered alcoholic journeyman in the minor leagues. “If he keeps working hard every day, I know Nathan has the talent to spend a few years bouncing around farm system teams while gradually developing a serious drinking problem,” said Garrett, adding that his son clearly has the arm strength and raw athleticism to spend half a decade growing increasingly bitter and self-destructive as he plays in front of only a few hundred spectators every game. “There’s no doubt in my mind that he could get all the way to Triple-A, screw up his shoulder, and drink away the rest of his life while resenting every choice he ever made. I just need to stay on top of him to make sure he gets there.” Garrett added that with enough determination, his son might eventually even grow estranged from his family before he turns 30."
Report: Some Dumb Fuck Out There Probably Wants His City To Host Olympics Now,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the two-week spectacle had likely stirred up a newfound passion and enthusiasm for the Games, reports confirmed Monday that some dumb fuck out there probably wants his city to host the Olympics now. “There’s an overwhelming likelihood that there’s a dipshit somewhere who, after watching the Rio Games, thinks hosting the Olympics would be a great way to show off everything great about whatever fucking city he lives in,” one report read in part, which also noted that in addition to believing the Olympics would generate some buzz about his hometown, the total shit-for-brains must think the Games would also provide a much-needed boost to the local economy. “At least one dope out there is really excited by the idea of hosting thousands of athletes and fans while being the center of the sports world for two weeks. You know he’s just dying to attend an opening ceremony celebrating the rich history of Kansas City or Houston. Fucking idiot.” The report added that the goddamn moron probably also believes hosting the Olympics would be a great reason to build a new stadium for his city’s NFL team."
"Olympic Officials: ‘On The Whole, Only 4 Or 5 Really Terrible Things Happened’","RIO DE JANEIRO—Reflecting on the recently concluded 2016 Summer Games in Rio, members of the International Olympic Committee held a press conference Sunday to proudly announce that on the whole, only about four or five really terrible things happened. “Looking back, all of it actually went pretty well over the past two weeks, aside from a handful of truly awful incidents,” said IOC president Thomas Bach, adding that while there were several absolutely embarrassing and ugly moments, the Rio Games “went a lot better than expected, generally speaking, which is pretty good.” “Admittedly, there were a few really horrific things that took place, and those were regrettable, certainly. But when you look past those, it was fine.” Bach then concluded the press conference by shrugging his shoulders and saying, “Brazil did all right.”"
Russian Olympic Officials Concerned After Learning Team’s Clean Urine Reservoir Almost Empty,"MOSCOW—Stressing that they are on the precipice of a major crisis, Russian Olympic Committee officials held a press conference Friday to confirm that the team’s clean urine reservoir is almost fully depleted. “The demand for fresh, clean urine over the past two weeks has greatly exceeded our supply, and unfortunately, if we aren’t able to get more soon, our athletes may run out well before the final Olympic events,” said committee president Alexander Zhukov, adding that the 400,000-gallon reservoir’s supply of clean urine is at its lowest point in decades. “We are currently enacting numerous urine management techniques in order to conserve what little we still have left, but if we are unable to replenish our supply soon, we will experience our nation’s worst clean urine shortage since the 1992 Summer Games.” At press time, in response to the emergency, the Chinese Olympic Committee confirmed that it will immediately donate 200,000 bottles of clean urine to the Russian delegation."
"Gold Medalist Triple-Jumper: ‘It’s All About Jumping Twice, And Then Jumping One More Time’","RIO DE JANEIRO—Candidly opening up about his winning strategy after taking gold in the event, U.S. Olympic triple-jumper Christian Taylor revealed to reporters Friday that the key to a successful triple jump is jumping twice, and then jumping one more time. “I jump two times, and then—and this is the most important part—I always jump another time; that third jump is really the most important jump,” said the two-time Olympian, adding that a competitor could, conceivably, perform only two jumps in the event, but their performance would be greatly improved by adding a third jump after the first two jumps. “The other thing is, you have to stop jumping after the third jump. If you jump a fourth time, that’s too many jumps. It’s not easy, though, so it can take years to truly master that part of the sport.” Taylor went on to patiently explain that the difference between the triple jump and the long jump was not one, but actually two jumps."
Rio Police Warn Olympic Runners To Avoid Miles 4 Through 23 Of Marathon Course,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Recommending considerable precautions during the event, police in Rio de Janeiro issued a warning Friday advising all runners to avoid miles 4 through 23 of the Olympic marathon course. “For their own personal safety, all marathoners are strongly urged to steer clear of these particularly dangerous sections of the running route,” said police chief Fernando Veloso, adding that even when in areas of the course designated as safe, runners should stick to well-lit parts of the road and always run in groups with at least three or four other competitors. “If you absolutely must pass through any areas of the marathon course between miles 4 and 23, we ask that you make sure to let a family member know so they can alert the authorities if you don’t arrive at mile 24 within a reasonable mile time. However, we strongly recommend that runners make alternate arrangements for getting from the start to the finish line.” Veloso added that runners should not wear flashy, expensive running shoes in order to avoid unwanted attention, and are also advised to carry a fake wallet in their shorts in case they are confronted by a mugger."
Kevin Durant Wins Gold In Men’s Individual Basketball,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Beating out Serbian Nikola Jokic by .87 points in order to claim the all-around title, U.S. forward Kevin Durant won Olympic gold Friday in men’s individual basketball, becoming the first man to win consecutive golds in the competition since Gary Payton at the 1996 and 2000 Games. “After securing a 15.23 in the ball-handling portion and a near-perfect 15.89 in the shooting section, Durant just needed to nail a few solid dunks to secure victory, and he did just that,” said NBC Olympic basketball analyst Doug Collins, adding that the gold medal hopes of eventual bronze medalist Jose Calderon of Spain were immediately extinguished after Durant laid down an impeccable two-handed reverse slam, gracefully landing on the court with complete balance and precision. “Durant had flawless form during his crossovers and spin moves, and then he capped it all off with a triple pump fake into a string of very difficult sky hooks. It was a real joy to watch.” Sources also confirmed that Durant’s U.S. teammate Carmelo Anthony fell agonizingly short of medaling after stumbling while attempting to complete a one-handed fadeaway jumper."
Olympic Fan Amazed By Grit And Determination Shown By Dan Patrick During Small Talk With Bob Costas,"SPOKANE, WA—Noting the veteran sportscaster’s perseverance through such difficult conditions, 31-year-old Olympics fan Roland Keller expressed his amazement to reporters Thursday at the sheer grit and determination displayed by Dan Patrick as he engaged in several moments of small talk with NBC host Bob Costas. “Most people would have just given up midway through, but Dan showed a lot of heart and plenty of mental toughness as he kept going,” said Keller, adding that he was stunned by Patrick’s seemingly superhuman ability to withstand over 30 seconds of inane back-and-forth chatter with Costas. “When Costas asked him how lively the parties on Copacabana Beach must be after Brazil advanced to the gold medal match in soccer, I thought he would buckle for sure. But he didn’t, even though it was clearly so painful. That’s what makes Dan Patrick one of the best.” Keller added that Patrick’s performance was the most impressive he’s seen since Mike Tirico managed to somehow defy the odds by finishing seven seasons on the air next to Jon Gruden in the Monday Night Football broadcast booth."
Yankees Honor Retiring A-Rod With 3-Second Tribute Video,"NEW YORK—Recognizing the 14-time All-Star as he played the final game of his 20-year MLB career Friday, the New York Yankees honored retiring third baseman Alex Rodriguez with a three-second-long tribute video. “We thought it was important to give Alex the sendoff he deserves,” said manager Joe Girardi of the tribute, which appeared on the stadium’s Jumbotron after the third inning and featured a 1.8-second clip of Rodriguez joining the team in 2004, followed by a photo of him raising the 2009 World Series trophy that appeared onscreen for 1.2 seconds, all to no music or sound whatsoever. “I think I speak for the entire organization when I say this video really shows exactly what Alex has meant to us.” The tribute reportedly concluded by displaying the hashtag “#ThankYouARrod [sic]” on the Jumbotron for five-tenths of a second before animated stadium trivia abruptly resumed."
"Yankees Sign A-Rod To 10-Year, $420 Million Front Office Consultant Contract","NEW YORK—Announcing the record-setting deal hours before his final game as a player, the New York Yankees revealed at a press conference Friday that the team has signed Alex Rodriguez to a 10-year, $420 million contract as a front office consultant. “Alex is a truly unique talent, and that’s why we’ve decided to heavily invest in his services as a member of our front office for the next decade,” said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, noting that the new contract, which comes with a $35 million signing bonus, will take effect immediately following Rodriguez’s last game for the club and will offer up to $100 million in further compensation if the 41-year-old achieves specified performance milestones. “Everyone in the organization couldn’t be more excited about this, and I think all the fans in New York will be thrilled to know that A-Rod will continue as part of the Yankees organization for a long, long time.” Cashman added that the terms also give Rodriguez the option to extend his front office contract in 2026 by an additional three years for $250 million."
Ryan Lochte Admits Olympic Pool Much Wetter Than He Remembered,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Opening up to reporters about the challenging conditions at the Rio Games, U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte admitted Thursday that the Olympic pool is much wetter than he remembered. “Honestly, the pool here feels way more wetter than the one in London,” said Lochte, confessing that he had some trouble adjusting to the “bigger wetness” of the pool at Rio’s Olympic Aquatics Stadium during his first lap of the men’s 4x200 freestyle relay. “The London pool had tons of wet parts, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as watery. This pool is more of a wetter wet. I was drenched the moment I dove in, and I stayed super soaked the whole time I was in the water. Plus, I was a lot more wet after.” Lochte also admitted that until Rio, he didn’t think any Olympic pool could possibly be wetter than the one at the 2008 Beijing Games."
Michael Phelps Spots Estranged Father Poseidon In Stands,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Immediately recognizing the booming, thunderous voice he hadn’t heard since he was 5 years old as he warmed up ahead of his first heat in the 200-meter individual medley, U.S. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps reportedly spotted his long-estranged father, Poseidon, God of the Sea, cheering for him Thursday in the stands of the Olympic Aquatics Stadium. “All right, Michael, go get ’em, son!” said Poseidon, who reportedly caused the arena’s windows to rattle and walls to shake as he bellowed and clapped with approval while Phelps stretched next to the pool. “Everybody, that’s my son out there! I love you, Mikey!” Sources confirmed Phelps appeared crestfallen after turning to acknowledge his father before realizing that the King of the Deep had instigated a fight with the parents of Italian swimmer Federico Turrini and impaled the couple on his trident."
"Michael Phelps Proudly Describes How Infant Son Subsists Off 12,000 Calories’ Worth Of Breast Milk Per Day","RIO DE JANEIRO—Glowing with pride as he spoke about his infant son’s strict daily nutritional regimen, U.S. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps explained to reporters Wednesday that his 3-month-old son, Boomer, consumes 12,000 calories of breast milk per day. “Boomer needs at least 2,000 calories during every feeding, and we usually have to feed him six to seven times a day,” said Phelps, adding that his child devours roughly 15 times the recommended daily caloric intake for the average 3-month-old male baby of his size and age. “He usually starts the day off with a breakfast of 90 fluid ounces of breast milk—about 10 bottles’ worth—and we give him 10 more bottles each for lunch and dinner. And then throughout the day he’ll have another 10 or 15 bottles of breast milk here and there as a snack. Obviously, this type of diet isn’t meant for all babies, but given how many calories he burns off in the crib, he needs that much breast milk to maintain his 12-pound frame.” Phelps added that his fiancée, Nicole Johnson, has to maintain a strict 55,000-calorie-per-day diet in order to keep Boomer properly nourished."
Anti-Doping Agency Unnerved By Bob Costas’ Repeated Requests To Submit Urine Sample,"MONTREAL—Saying they have received multiple phone calls and emails from the NBC Sports host every day for the past four weeks, members of the World Anti-Doping Agency told reporters Tuesday they were extremely unnerved by Bob Costas’ repeated requests to submit his own urine sample ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics. “When we were first contacted by Mr. Costas back in early July, we thought it was a mistake, but then he called us five more times that same day trying to talk us into accepting and testing his urine, and he hasn’t stopped reaching out to us ever since—it’s getting a bit uncomfortable,” said WADA chair Beckie Scott, adding that the agency has also received 19 unsolicited, perfectly sealed and labeled test kits in the mail from Mr. Costas despite never sending him any of the necessary materials to provide a specimen in the first place. “We’ve made it extremely clear to him that broadcasters do not have to undergo this process, but that hasn’t deterred him from continuing to fax us his filled-out paperwork and release forms. Last week, he even showed up at our facility in person carrying about a dozen full collection cups of his own urine. It’s pretty disturbing, to be completely honest.” At press time, Scott reported that another package had just arrived from Costas containing blood samples, a cheek swab, and several ounces of fecal matter, with a note from the anchor reading “Just in case.”"
NBC Details Inspirational Story Of Sponsor’s Journey To Olympics,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Chronicling what many have called the most touching and incredible narrative of the Rio Games, NBC aired a special feature Monday about the inspirational story of Bridgestone’s journey to the 2016 Olympics. “It’s been such a long road, and at times it seemed impossible, but we never gave up, and now we’re here in Rio alongside all the biggest brands in the world,” Bridgestone CEO Masaaki Tsuya said during the three-minute NBC piece, adding that he always believed the 85-year-old auto manufacturer’s logo could someday be on the Olympic medal podium in front of billions of consumers around the world. “You know, everyone always used to say we were too small, or that our marketing team wasn’t experienced enough, but we proved them wrong. It just goes to show that any brand, no matter where they’re headquartered or how strong their sales are, can defy the odds and achieve the Olympic dream. We’re proof of that.” Tsuya went on to credit Heineken’s incredible commercial performance during the 2012 London Games for inspiring Bridgestone to set its sights on the Olympics."
Olympics Head Priestess Slits Throat Of Official Rio Mascot To Sanctify Opening Ceremony,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Gripping the brightly colored character neck and displaying him as an offering to ensure a successful Games, Olympics head priestess Esmeralda Caixeta sanctified the opening ceremony by slitting the throat of Rio mascot Vinicius from ear to ear, sources confirmed Friday. “Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like the priestess has entered the stadium alongside a group of cloaked, chanting monks to bless the Rio Games with a traditional blood sacrifice,” NBC commentator Bob Costas said as the hooded priestess jerked the mascot’s smiling, furry head back and slowly drew a dagger across his exposed throat, using an ornamental bowl to collect the spraying blood. “Now she’s using her bare hands to anoint the torchbearer’s face with the fallen mascot’s blood before the cauldron is lit, which is an Olympic tradition dating back to the eighth century B.C. Of course, the priestess’s age is unknown, but she is said to have performed this sacrament for every opening ceremony since the original festivals in Olympia. Folks, this is a real treat.” The high priestess then reportedly beheaded Vinicius, kicked his still-twitching body off the stage, and announced, in a booming voice, “I declare open the Games of Rio celebrating the 31st Olympiad of the modern era,” as the mascot’s limp body tumbled down the stadium steps."
Olympics Officials Clearly Trying To Buy More Time With 6-Day-Long Opening Ceremony Performance,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Citing the variety of long, drawn-out performances and back-to-back recitations of the Olympic oath in 30 different languages, sources confirmed Friday that Rio Olympics officials were clearly trying to buy more time with a six-day-long opening ceremony. “For those just tuning in, the pace of the Parade of Nations has significantly slowed, and the procession is entering its third lap of the stadium,” said NBC commentator Matt Lauer of the organizers’ evident attempts to stall the start of the games, which included an extended 47-minute performance of the Brazilian national anthem that nearly drowned out the din of hammering, power saws, and construction vehicles emanating from outside the stadium. “And now the samba dancers have returned to the field to reprise a routine based on Rio’s carnival festival. I believe we’ve seen this number about three or four times already, but you really have to appreciate the showmanship on display. I can’t wait to see what’s in store for us on day two of the opening ceremony.” At press time, event organizers were attempting to buy more time through stretching out the fireworks display by launching one rocket every hour."
Performers Frantically Trying To Incorporate Spewing Sewage Pipe Into Rio Opening Ceremony,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Looking around at one another with a mix of dismay and confusion while continuing their choreography, performers at Maracanã Stadium frantically attempted to incorporate a ruptured, spewing sewage pipe into the Rio Olympics opening ceremony Friday. “We knew billions of people around the world were watching, so once we saw that pipe burst, we just started making up a routine around it,” said 24-year-old Maria Santos, one of dozens of samba dancers who sashayed around the pipe and performed sultry hip movements while their elaborate feathered costumes were drenched in a torrent of human excrement. “It wasn’t easy, especially pretending like some of the dancers vomiting was part of the show. But once we all got our kicks in sync to the beat of the pipe spurting a mix of urine and shit, everything came together pretty well.” At press time, Games organizers were trying to continue smiling and clapping as they watched a sinkhole open up inside the stadium and swallow the Olympic cauldron whole."
Weary Nation Happy It Gets To Watch Socio-Political Failings Of Another Country For 2 Weeks,"WASHINGTON—Ahead of the highly anticipated Summer Olympics in Rio, millions of weary and emotionally exhausted Americans expressed excitement Friday at getting the chance to watch the socio-political failings of another country for two weeks. “After spending pretty much every day being confronted by growing income inequality and political corruption here at home, it’ll be kind of nice to turn on the TV and watch another country fall apart at the seams for a little while,” said 36-year-old Philadelphia resident Greg Thatcher, echoing the sentiments of Americans across the country who confirmed that they are looking forward to the next 16 days of viewing a different nation crippled by failing schools, inadequate health care, and a crumbling transportation infrastructure. “Seeing the U.K. collapse in on itself from inept leadership and government infighting was nice, but that only lasted for a few days. Now, we have a good two weeks ahead of us to watch a democratic society other than ours fracture at every level and drive itself into total ruin. I can’t wait.” Many Americans also confirmed that they are already looking forward to a full month of watching the decline of a different global superpower during the 2018 World Cup in Russia."
Officials Worried Olympic Cemetery Won’t Be Completed In Time For Games,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Stressing that time is quickly running out and that construction is not nearly complete, organizers of the 2016 Olympics expressed concern Wednesday that the official Olympic Cemetery would not be completed in time for the games. “We are only days away from the opening ceremony, but there is still considerable work to be done to ensure that the cemetery can comfortably accommodate all the athletes, media members, and fans we expect over the course of the next two weeks,” said a senior International Olympic Committee official speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that progress on the expansive, multimillion-dollar burial site has been repeatedly delayed by budgetary issues stemming from the high cost of caskets and a recent strike by gravediggers demanding better working conditions. “At this point, less than half of the burial plots are ready, there is still scaffolding over the mausoleums, and we’re still awaiting dozens of gravestones being shipped from China. But we will do our best, and hopefully everything will be ready before the bodies begin arriving.” The IOC official did confirm, however, that enough of the Olympic Cemetery has been completed to at least house dozens of migrant workers who were part of its construction."
Patriots Hoping Emaciated Tom Brady Will End Hunger Strike Over Suspension Appeal In Time For Training Camp,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Despite the severely emaciated quarterback vowing to continue his protest until his four-game suspension is overturned, members of the New England Patriots told reporters Wednesday they remain hopeful that Tom Brady will end his hunger strike in time for training camp. “While Tom is adamant that his self-starvation remains the best way to draw attention to his ongoing legal battle, we are all optimistic that he will agree to begin eating before full practices get underway,” said Patriots owner Robert Kraft, acknowledging that the lethargic and sore-covered Brady, who for the past 23 days has refused all sustenance beyond water, has lost over 40 pounds and is no longer capable of standing up under his own power. “I know he wants to keep going until his case reaches the Supreme Court, but he’s already partially blind and his hair has started to fall out, so we’re all begging him to just eat something. Tom is very determined, though, so this could very well extend into the preseason.” At press time, the NFL refused to comment on fresh allegations that they have begun restraining and force-feeding Brady through a nasal tube once a day."
Tim Duncan Proudly Reflects On All The Degrees He Accumulated During 19-Year NBA Career,"SAN ANTONIO—Speaking to reporters after announcing his retirement from professional basketball, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan proudly reflected on all of the academic degrees he accumulated during his 19 years in the NBA. “You know, all of my diplomas are special to me, but my Ph.D. in marine chemistry from MIT will probably always mean the most,” said Duncan, adding that successfully defending his dissertation before the program’s faculty board in 2008 was one of the personal highlights of a career that also saw him complete graduate degrees in electrical engineering, European history, and Latin from Northwestern, UCLA, and Boston College, respectively. “My first Master of Science degree in 1998 definitely seemed like the hardest one to earn, although I think finishing two more [in sociology and statistics] during back-to-back years was pretty tough too. Of course, finally standing on the graduation stage last May to accept my joint JD-MBA from the University of Texas is also something I’ll never forget.” Duncan added that none of his accomplishments would have been possible without the support of his family and faculty advisors."
Cavs Teammates Sheepishly Tell Kevin Love They’re Not Aware Of Any Postgame Parties,"OAKLAND, CA—In the midst of celebrating the team’s first NBA title Sunday after defeating the Golden State Warriors, sources confirmed that Cleveland Cavaliers players sheepishly told power forward Kevin Love that they weren’t aware of any postgame parties taking place later in the night. “I don’t think anyone’s really doing anything after this, at least as far as I know,” small forward Iman Shumpert was overheard telling Love in the Cavaliers locker room, adding that the other players will “probably just go back to the team hotel and spend time with their families.” “It’s getting kind of late, and I’m actually pretty exhausted after that game, so I’m not going out. But if I hear about something fun going on, I’ll definitely text you.” At press time, the rest of the players were reportedly pretending to pack up their gear as Love walked out of the locker room to board an otherwise empty team bus."
God Clarifies That He Still Hates Cleveland Fans Despite Cavaliers Championship,"THE HEAVENS—Despite allowing the Cavaliers to win the city’s first major sports championship in 52 years, God Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth, confirmed Sunday that He still hates Cleveland fans. “I just figured that enough is enough, so I decided to throw them a bone and finally give them a title, but believe me, I still can’t stand Cleveland teams or their fans,” said the Lord, adding that even though He decided not to intervene in order to prevent the Cavaliers from winning Game 7 against the Golden State Warriors, He “still really enjoys” watching Cleveland fans suffer after heartbreaking losses. “Don’t get me wrong, I love LeBron. My original plan was actually to get Cleveland’s hopes up by having him born in Ohio and drafted by the Cavs before he left to go win titles elsewhere without ever coming back. I knew that would absolutely crush the fans, but then I kind of felt bad about it, so I changed my mind since I wanted LeBron to win one in Cleveland. But I don’t give a shit about Cleveland fans, and I’ll see to it that they never win anything again.” God also clarified that His contempt for Cleveland fans is nothing compared to His total and utter hatred for “those fucking scumbag fans” in Philadelphia."
"Oh Good, Sound Of Explosion At Soccer Stadium Was Just Fan With Enormous Flare Gun","SAINT-ÉTIENNE, FRANCE—Midway through Friday’s Euro 2016 group stage match between the Czech Republic and Croatia, sources confirmed that, oh good, the sound of an explosion that just echoed throughout the stadium was only a fan firing an enormous flare gun. “As soon as I heard that loud blast coming from somewhere off the field, my heart sank and I braced for the worst, but thankfully, it was only some guy in the stands shooting off a flare,” said 31-year-old Daniel Vargas of McLean, VA, adding that his brief surge of panic was assuaged after the announcer clarified that the noise emanated from a flare and not, as initially assumed by all television viewers, an explosion amid some kind of horrific terrorist attack. “I’m just relieved that all the smoke engulfing a quarter of the stadium wasn’t the result of anything that hurt or killed anyone. It’s just some drunk guy with a scarf wrapped around the lower half of his face firing a flare gun that he was apparently allowed to bring inside the stadium. That’s great to know.” At press time, Christ, another one just went off."
"Nation Demands More Golf Highlights Where Ball Lands On Green, But Then Rolls All The Way Back Down Hill","WASHINGTON—Stressing the urgent need for an increase in such clips both on television and the internet, Americans across the nation fiercely and unanimously demanded to see more golf highlights where the ball lands on the green, but then rolls all the way back down a big hill, sources confirmed Tuesday. “I love it when the ball lands on the edge of a hill pretty close to the hole, stops for just a second, and then starts rolling backwards faster and faster until it’s all the way in the rough,” said 33-year-old Trevor Burkin of Frederick, MD, who, like millions of other Americans, called for more frequent SportsCenter highlights in which the ball rolls so far that it eventually falls into a sand trap or water hazard. “I also want the announcer to say something like ‘Uh-oh, wait a minute’ right when the ball starts rolling away from the hole, and then the camera should show the golfer leaning his head back with his eyes closed out of frustration. That’s what I want. I want more of that.” Many Americans added that in the meantime, they would settle for more highlights of long putts where the ball hangs right on the edge of the hole, but doesn’t go in."
NHL Admits It Has No Idea Who Guys With White Gloves Transporting Stanley Cup Are,"NEW YORK—Confessing that they are unable to explain the presence of the two men who always accompany the championship trophy, officials from the NHL admitted Friday that they have absolutely no idea who the guys with white gloves carrying the Stanley Cup actually are. “They just showed up after the Oilers won Game 7 of the 1987 Finals, holding the Stanley Cup as they walked onto the ice for the trophy presentation, and it was only later that we realized no one ever hired them or asked them to do that,” said league executive John Payette, who further clarified that the two men are not, and have never been, NHL employees or on the league’s payroll. “They never speak, which is a little off-putting, but they’re constantly smiling, so they seem pretty nice. Since they always show up on time with the Cup for potential championship-clinching games every year, we just let them keep doing it. But we have no idea who they are, where they came from, or why they’re doing this.” At press time, the SAP Center arena staff in San Jose confirmed that the two men were standing completely still in an equipment room with the lights off, smiling and quietly staring straight ahead as they held the Stanley Cup."
Draymond Green Able To List From Memory Every Player Drafted Before Him In NBA History,"CLEVELAND—Claiming that it has been a constant source of motivation throughout his career, Golden State Warriors power forward Draymond Green revealed to reporters Thursday that he is able to recite, completely from memory, the names of every single player drafted ahead of him in NBA history. “First was Clifton McNeely to the Pittsburgh Ironmen in 1947, then the [Toronto] Huskies took Glen Selbo, and third was Boston, who took Bulbs Ehlers,” said Green, taking the next several hours to list all 2,786 players who were selected, in order, during the six decades before he was chosen by the Warriors with the 35th overall pick of the 2012 NBA Draft. “I haven’t forgotten that Dion Waiters, Tayshaun Prince, Stephon Marbury, Dan Majerle, Keith Van Horn, Rafer Alston, Grant Hill, Dominique Wilkins, John Havlicek, [1973 fifth-round pick] Dennis Bell, and Yao Ming were chosen before me, and I never will. It’s something I think about all the time, because I want to prove that I’m just as good as any of those guys.” Green went on to say that he does feel vindicated by the fact that he has an NBA championship ring, unlike Bill McGill, who was selected prior to him by the Chicago Zephyrs with the first overall pick in 1962."
Visionary Sports Columnist Asserts That Muhammad Ali’s Greatest Fight Wasn’t In The Ring,"BALTIMORE—Providing a shrewd and ingenious take on the late boxer’s life, visionary Baltimore Sun columnist Jason Lowe reportedly asserted Monday that Muhammad Ali’s greatest fight did not, in fact, take place in the ring. “Muhammad Ali will certainly go down in history as one of the best heavyweight boxers of all time, but it was outside of the ring where he won his greatest, most formidable fights,” the article read in part, audaciously presenting Lowe’s astute and perceptive argument that Ali’s deadliest weapons were not his fists, but rather his words and compassion. “Ali faced the likes of Joe Frazier and George Foreman, however, let’s not forget that his most daunting opponents were racism and prejudice in America. He was a truly great fighter, but it is ultimately Ali’s opposition to fighting that will define his legacy.” The columnist concluded the article by positing that it was “now up to each and every single one of us to continue fighting until injustice has been knocked out.”"
Dozens Of Social Issues Thankful They Never Had To Go Toe-To-Toe With Muhammad Ali,"WASHINGTON—Speaking out on the legacy of one of the 20th century’s most towering figures in both sports and the civil rights movement following his recent passing, dozens of social issues reported Monday that they were extremely thankful they never had to go toe-to-toe with Muhammad Ali. “Ali was absolutely ferocious—thank God we never had to face him, ’cause there’s no way we would have lasted,” said a representative for the handful of detrimental social ills that went unconfronted by Ali during his lifetime, including intolerance against the LGBTQ community, predatory lending, cyberbullying, and numerous other ingrained problems facing American society. “He was such a fierce, tireless opponent. He never let up even for a moment in any of his high-profile fights against discrimination or inequality. As a source of societal oppression, you just prayed you never found yourself up against someone like that, especially back when he was in his prime. God, did he ever do a number on racism and religious bigotry in the ’60s and ’70s.” The collection of social issues added that their only regret was feeling that, with Ali gone, there was no longer a competitor anywhere worthy of fighting them."
Carson Wentz Hoping To Just Skip To Part Where He’s Respected Veteran Backup QB,"PHILADELPHIA—Reflecting on his career aspirations after being selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft, rookie quarterback Carson Wentz admitted to reporters Tuesday that he is simply hoping to skip to the part where he is a respected veteran backup. “Frankly, I’d love to fast-forward to when I’m viewed as an experienced, reliable game manager who could run the offense if the team’s starter goes down,” said Wentz, adding that, after likely spending the next five to eight years bouncing around at least three different organizations, he is looking forward to being praised by commentators as a consummate professional who provides input to coaches and teammates from the sidelines. “Let’s jump to when I’m 31 and getting paid $2 million a year to mentor a young franchise quarterback or provide some competition to a struggling starter during training camp. You know, someone who nobody expects anything from, but who might start the last six games of a season and lead maybe the Dolphins or Chiefs to a wild-card spot before returning to a backup role the next year. I’m ready to be that guy.” Wentz added that he also wouldn’t mind going straight to the years of his life during which he enjoys moderate success as an assistant coach for a small Division II college football team."
Michael Phelps’ Fiancée Gives Birth To Healthy 6-Pound Tadpole,"TEMPE, AZ—Saying that he is “so overjoyed, excited, and thankful,” 18-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps announced Sunday that his fiancée has given birth to a healthy 6-pound tadpole. “On behalf of myself and Nicole, I’m thrilled to say that on May 5 at 7:21 p.m., we welcomed a healthy, happy male tadpole, weighing in at 6 pounds and 11 ounces, with a 5-inch tail,” read a statement from Phelps, which was accompanied by a photo of the smiling 30-year-old Olympian holding the newborn in his arms while gently caressing its gills. “Nicole and I are obviously incredibly tired after a lengthy 17-hour hatching, but we’re doing fine and can’t wait to get to know the newest member of our family.” At press time, Phelps’ publicist confirmed that the tadpole is now swimming comfortably with its parents back at the family’s water tank."
Unregistered Horses Meet Under Cover Of Darkness For Kentucky Street Derby,"LOUISVILLE, KY—Having trotted to an underpass on the outskirts of the city where they were surrounded by numerous entourages and bikini-clad women, over a dozen unregistered horses reportedly met under the cover of darkness Saturday for an illegal Kentucky Street Derby. “We usually meet here to race because it’s out of the way and there’s 12 furlongs of open road, plus nobody around here gives a shit if the horses make a lot of noise,” a jockey who only went by the name “Two-Crop” told reporters, as various riders made last-minute adjustments to their elaborately decorated, neon-painted saddles and blue LED underbody lights, with several thoroughbreds loudly neighing in anticipation of the race. “There’s no fuckin’ around out here. It’s ten thousand cash to enter the race, winner take all. And if you lose, you might have to hand over your filly to the jockey who beat you.” Just as the contestants were lining up behind the hand-drawn chalk outline of a starting gate, a number of mounted police officers descended on the scene, causing the jockeys to quickly jump on their steeds and gallop away in all different directions."
Conclusion Of Draft Marks Last Time Coach To Ever Scrutinize Player’s Character,"CHICAGO—Following the 21-year-old linebacker’s selection in the sixth round, reports confirmed Thursday that the conclusion of the 2016 NFL Draft marked the final time that linebacker Lawrence Davies’ character will ever be scrutinized by his new head coach. According to reports, after the team spent months compiling a pre-draft file that included a background check and a comprehensive outline of personality traits and potential character issues, the moment when Davies’ name was announced on the draft stage represented a culmination of the short-lived period wherein his coach showed interest in closely examining the defensive player’s personal life and off-the-field activities. Sources familiar with the situation revealed that the conclusion of the draft process also signified a definitive end to any coach or trainer thinking critically about Davies’ upbringing, his family, his friends, his romantic relationships, his drinking habits, and the general demeanor with which he interacts with other people in any non-football-related setting. As soon as the former college player penned his name on a four-year rookie contract, not a single person on the coaching staff—nor anyone working in the team’s front office—reportedly felt the need to continue watching Davies for potential warning signs of troublesome behavior in the future, with the organization now taking anything he tells them completely at face value. At press time, sources also confirmed that the end of the draft also signaled the last time that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will think of Davies as anything but a totally replaceable commodity."
Premier League On Leicester City Title: ‘Order Will Soon Be Restored’,"LONDONーShortly after Leicester City’s improbable title run culminated in the club clinching their first championship, executives from the Premier League issued a statement Sunday vowing that order will soon be restored. “We would like to inform fans of the Barclays Premier League that steps will be taken to ensure the traditional paradigms are reestablished in time for the 2016-2017 season,” read the statement in part, which did not go on to offer any specifics regarding the measures it referenced, but did stress that a reversion to the league’s long-held competitive hierarchy would be “swift and permanent.” “This is an immediate priority that has our full commitment, and as such, we are willing to spend any and all requisite resources to guarantee a return to what is expected and acceptable. Until that is achieved, we will offer no further comment.” Just hours after the statement’s publication, the Premier League released the 2016-2017 season schedule, which reportedly indicated that Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester City will each play 38 home games."
Extra Leicester Police Being Deployed To Join In With Celebrating Leicester City Fans After Title Win,"LEICESTER, ENGLAND—In anticipation of the club’s first-ever top-flight league championship in its 132-year history, officials from the Leicestershire Police announced Monday that they have deployed additional forces in order to join in with Leicester City fans celebrating their Premier League title. “Given the massive turnout we are expecting, we have significantly increased our police presence so that we are able to really enjoy Leicester’s league championship together with all the fans,” said chief constable Simon Cole, adding that several additional units of officers, who will be outfitted with team scarves and replica jerseys, will be strategically positioned at various points throughout the city to spray beer bottles and sing team chants alongside thousands of Leicester City supporters. “We will also have horse-mounted patrols to lift up team banners, as well as officers driving police cars through the most congested streets while honking their horns and leaning out their windows screaming ‘Champions!’ If celebrations start to get out of hand, we will be right there to join in, climb up traffic lights, and go completely nuts. C’mon you Foxes!” At press time, numerous police units had rushed to the scene after several officers requested immediate backup to help turn over a parked car and jump on top of it."
Phillie Phanatic Inducted Into Italian American Sports Hall Of Fame,"CHICAGO—Honoring his many achievements both on and off the field throughout his glittering career, the Phillie Phanatic was officially inducted Monday into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. “For 28 years, the Phanatic has excelled at the highest level of professional baseball while also embodying the ideals and values of the Italian-American community, and it is our great pleasure to welcome him into the Hall of Fame Class of 2016,” NIASHF director George Randazzo said during a ceremony at the organization’s museum where a bronze bust of the green-furred creature was permanently installed between portraits of boxer Arturo Gatti and University of Connecticut women’s basketball coach Geno Auriemma. “The Phanatic began his career at a time when ugly stereotypes of Italians still lingered in our society, but with grace, courage, and skill, he preserved and represented his heritage with distinction, all while paving the way for the next generation of Italian Americans who may wish to follow in his footsteps. We at the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame are extremely proud to call the Phillie Phanatic one of our own.” According to sources, the induction comes just months after Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Massachusetts renamed its gymnasium after the Phanatic to honor his outstanding high school career."
"Cubs Fans Cautiously Optimistic After Jake Arrieta Throws 8th No-Hitter, Team Scores Over 30 Runs For 12th Consecutive Game","CHICAGO—Stressing that “it’s only April” and that “there’s a lot of baseball still to play,” Cubs fans throughout Chicago told reporters Thursday that they remain cautiously optimistic about their World Series chances after pitcher Jake Arrieta threw his eighth no-hitter of the season, with the team scoring over 30 runs for the 12th straight game. “The Cubs have started really well, and Kris Bryant already has 38 home runs on the year, but it won’t matter unless they can play like this in October,” said longtime fan Spencer Palmer, noting that while he is happy with their performances, he isn’t getting ahead of himself after the Cubs’ five-game sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals by a combined score of 168-0, which included seven different batters hitting for the cycle. “Arrieta’s thrown six perfect games in his last 10 starts, but if he gets hurt, we really just have Jon Lester, John Lackey, and Jason Hammel, and they’ve only thrown five no-hitters between them all season. If everyone can stay healthy and maintain their average of two triple plays per game, I think they’ll have a great shot in the playoffs. But we’ll see.” At press time, Palmer had reportedly lost all faith in the Cubs’ hopes for a championship after watching right fielder Jason Heyward strike out for the first time all season."
Curt Schilling Quietly Relieved He No Longer Needs To Censor Self For 3 Hours Once A Week,"BRISTOL, CT—Following his recent termination from ESPN as a result of his controversial comments regarding transgender rights, baseball commentator and former Major League pitcher Curt Schilling told reporters Thursday he is quietly relieved he will no longer need to censor himself for three hours each week on Monday Night Baseball. “While I’m disappointed with ESPN’s decision, it’s actually pretty nice to know I won’t have to hold back any of my opinions on social or political issues for the entire duration of a baseball game four times a month,” said Schilling, describing the immense difficulty he faced sitting through a whole nine-inning game without sharing his extensive beliefs regarding the death of the traditional American family unit or the moral failings of women who choose to have an abortion. “Most nights, it was absolutely killing me that I couldn’t just start ripping on all the inner-city hoodlums who we, the taxpayers, have been coddling. Sure, there were the commercial breaks where I could finally relax and tell [play-by-play announcer Dave] Flemming that I thought all the illegals coming into America were making this country unrecognizable from the one of my youth, but for the most part, I was just dying out there holding my tongue. Don’t even get me started on what it was like if the game went to extra innings.” When asked about his future career plans, Schilling reportedly entered into a 25-minute-long rant arguing that gun violence could be prevented by sterilizing the mentally ill."
Guy At Gym Has Precious Little Diary To Keep Track Of All His Exercises,"NEW BERLIN, WI—Making sure to date the page before recording all the juiciest and most private details from his daily exercise routine, local gym-goer Phillip Keller reportedly took out his precious little diary Thursday in order to keep track of his workout. “I like to jot down everything I do so I can track my progress,” said the 27-year-old, who reportedly carries his adorable leather-bound journal with him wherever he goes inside Belmont Fitness Center, using the blank page as a sanctuary in which to freely pour his heart out over the number of sets and reps he performs during each exercise. “It’s a great way to stay motivated, and it also helps me vary up my training so I’m not just doing the same stuff every week.” After finishing his workout and showering, Keller reportedly sat in the locker room and excitedly ventured into his diary once more, taking a quiet moment to express his innermost hopes and dreams about reaching new fitness goals by the end of the month."
Charles Barkley Insists Today’s Fans Couldn’t Win Contests During Tougher ’90s-Era NBA Halftimes,"ATLANTA—Stressing that most of the competitions over the past several seasons have been “boring” and “totally unwatchable,” Hall of Famer and Inside The NBA analyst Charles Barkley insisted Monday night that modern basketball fans wouldn’t stand a chance of winning during the far tougher halftime contests of the 1990s. “I’m sorry, but these halftimes nowadays don’t even compare—back then it was so much faster and more demanding, not this nonsense where you get a whole minute of unlimited tries to sink a half-court shot,” said Barkley, adding that “anybody who knows anything about halftime” is aware that the numerous rule changes over the past two decades have completely changed the promotional fan contests. “Back in the ’90s, guys couldn’t just get to the free-throw line and sink 10 shots in a row to win free floor-side seats for next season. If you wanted to win, you’d have to shoot the ball backwards over your head with a blindfold on, or you’d have to hit a layup, free throw, three-pointer, and half-court shot. C’mon now, can you imagine how many new cars one of the contestants from ’95 or ’96 would win now? They’d absolutely kill these wimps.” Despite his criticisms, Barkley admittedly conceded that today’s NBA fans are by far much larger compared to 20 years ago."
Lakers Players Curious What It Must Be Like To Be Inspired By Kobe Bryant,"LOS ANGELES—Amid a massive outpouring of acclaim from fans, fellow athletes, and media members ahead of his retirement, players on the Los Angeles Lakers admitted to reporters Thursday that they are kind of curious what it must be like to be inspired by Kobe Bryant. “I keep hearing all these players on other teams and athletes from other sports talk about how much they were motivated by Kobe’s work ethic and competitive drive, so I can’t help but wonder what that would feel like,” said Lakers power forward Brandon Bass, adding that he has trouble even imagining Bryant as someone who he looks up to and tries to replicate. “I mean, Kobe is clearly helping people push themselves to be better and strive to achieve great things—it’s just kind of hard to wrap my head around that one.” Many Lakers players noted, however, that they “totally understand” the deluge of hatred aimed at Bryant from opposing fans throughout his 20-year career."
Man Ready To Believe Any Statistic About How Good Warriors Were This Season,"HAMPTON, VA—Explaining that the team’s regular-season dominance made him unlikely to question any accomplishment attributed to them, local 29-year-old Jared Dwyer told reporters Thursday that he is ready to believe absolutely any statistic about how good the Golden State Warriors were this year. “At this point, you could tell me that the Warriors shot over 70 percent from three as a team, or that they outscored opponents in the second half by an average of 40 points, and I’d just take it at face value,” said Dwyer, who added that he would not question any unprecedented or otherwise seemingly impossible offensive statistics about the Warriors that he sees on an ESPN graphic or reads on a random Twitter account. “I honestly wouldn’t bat an eye at a stat that said Steph Curry hasn’t missed a three from inside 25 feet since November, or that Draymond Green out-rebounded the entire other team combined in a majority of games this season. Hell, it wouldn’t surprise me if I heard the Warriors have the highest-ever number of points per game against teams with a winning record. All of that’s probably true, for all I know.” Dwyer added that he is equally prepared to believe absolutely any story about how dysfunctional the Los Angeles Lakers have been this year."
Jordan Spieth’s Family To Wait A Few Days Before Asking Him What The Fuck Happened,"DALLAS—Following the pro golfer’s historic collapse during the final holes of the Masters Tournament, Jordan Spieth’s family members confirmed Monday that they will probably wait a few days before asking him what the fuck happened. “It’s been a rough 24 hours for Jordan, so we’ll give him his space for a while before bringing up how badly he just shit the bed,” said Spieth’s mother, Christine, suggesting that the family’s Friday night dinner might be the most appropriate time to finally ask the 22-year-old how he managed such a mind-boggling choke job. “We’ll just have to dance around the fact that he really screwed the pooch for the next few days. There will be plenty of time to ask him what the hell he was doing out there. Right now, he needs to decompress and be alone with his thoughts.” Family members told reporters that any discussion of the nearly $1 million in prize money that Spieth missed out on would be avoided indefinitely."
Jim Nantz Sitting In Corner Of Augusta Clubhouse Locker Room Watching Golfers Change,"AUGUSTA, GA—Expressing their unease at the veteran sportscaster’s behavior as they prepared for the second round of the Masters, multiple golfers told reporters Friday that Jim Nantz has been sitting in the corner of the Augusta National clubhouse locker room and watching them change. “I was in the clubhouse this morning getting dressed, and Jim was just sitting there, not saying a word, with his eyes fixed on me the whole time,” said golfer Jason Day, adding that when he attempted to greet Nantz, the 56-year-old broadcaster nodded his head slightly before slowly gazing up and down Day’s body and softly muttering “Mmm.” “He’s over by Rory McIlroy’s locker, and after Rory came back from the shower, he scooted over a little on the bench, but then just watched Rory dry himself off and put his clothes on. He hasn’t moved from that spot for hours. I don’t know about the other guys, but I’m not changing in the clubhouse as long as he’s still there.” At press time, several golfers were looking on in disgust as Nantz removed a sweaty polo shirt from Rickie Fowler’s locker, held it up to his nostrils, and inhaled deeply."
Rangers Disgusted By Prince Fielder Leaving Chewed-Up Bats All Over Dugout,"ARLINGTON, TX—Complaining that he should have dropped the habit a long time ago, members of the Texas Rangers admitted to reporters Thursday that they are constantly disgusted by first baseman Prince Fielder’s tendency to leave chewed-up baseball bats all over the dugout. “Prince is always taking other guys’ bats and gnawing on them—it’s so gross,” said Rangers left fielder Ian Desmond, who added that he and other players will often reach for their bats in the dugout rack, only to find them covered in Fielder’s teeth marks and wet with drool. “I don’t think he even notices when he’s doing it. Sometimes he’ll be talking to me on the bench and suddenly he’ll start chomping on one. I wish he would at least chew on his own bats, because there’s no way I’m using one of mine after he’s had it in his mouth.” Desmond added that he is just thankful Fielder has finally stopped spitting wet baseballs at teammates taking naps in the clubhouse."
Frustrated UNC Student Too Busy Studying For Players’ Tests To Watch Title Game,"CHAPEL HILL, NC—Lamenting that he won’t be able to watch the highly anticipated game with his friends, University of North Carolina junior Aaron Wright expressed his frustration Monday that he will be too busy studying for players’ tests to watch the Tar Heels play Villanova for the NCAA National Championship. “Man, I wish I could watch tonight, but there are four different exams I have to prepare for this week,” said Wright, adding that he will only be able to periodically check the game’s score on his phone while cramming all night for senior forward Brice Johnson’s human physiology exam. “I might stream it on my laptop during the second half just to have it on in the background, but I’ll probably be too busy trying to memorize equations for the stats test [small forward] Justin Jackson has on Wednesday to even pay attention to what’s happening. God, this sucks.” At press time, Wright was ignoring a slew of text messages from his roommate about the game while rushing to finish the 12-page European history paper junior guard Kanler Coker has due tomorrow morning."
Man Unsure He’s Done Enough Research To Take All The Fun Out Of Making NCAA Bracket,"TOLEDO, OH—Noting that he simply ran out of time this year, 32-year-old Collin Buckley admitted to reporters Wednesday that he may not have done enough research to take all the fun out of filling out his NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament bracket. “I actually enjoyed putting some of this together, which makes me wonder if I spent enough time reading conflicting articles about which teams are poised to pull off upsets,” said a visibly disappointed Buckley, adding that while he consulted the RPI rankings and read most of the 34 matchup summaries by ESPN analyst Jay Bilas, he still took some pleasure in making certain picks based purely on his gut feeling or his hatred of certain schools. “I put Texas in the Final Four just because I like [head coach] Shaka Smart, and I have Duke going out in the second round since it’d be fun to see them get dumped so early, so I probably didn’t analyze as much of the data as I should have in order to turn this into a totally and utterly joyless experience.” Buckley added that, at the very least, he invested enough time to guarantee he will not enjoy any of the amazing and inspiring upsets he failed to pick."
Teary-Eyed Robert Griffin III Slips On Draft Day Suit Again,"WASHINGTON—With several tears streaming down his face as he stood alone in his bedroom’s walk-in closet, sources confirmed Wednesday that former Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III slipped on the suit he wore to the 2012 NFL Draft. “I’m so excited for the opportunity to finally play in the NFL and show what I can do,” said Griffin, who quietly sniffled while smiling and shaking an invisible hand presumably belonging to league commissioner Roger Goodell. “I know I have a lot to prove, and it won’t be easy, but my goal is to be the best quarterback in the league. I can’t wait to get started in Washington—this is a dream come true.” At press time, a look of pure contentment came over Griffin’s face after he put on a Redskins hat, shut his eyes, and held up an old practice jersey with both hands."
Nation’s Workload To Be Completed During Timeouts Today,"WASHINGTON—According to a new report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the overwhelming majority of the nation’s workload will be completed today during timeouts in March Madness games. “Our research indicates that over 90 percent of all work tasks in both the public and private sectors will be carried out in one- to two-minute bursts during TV timeouts,” said agency spokesperson Carrie Everett, adding that the vast majority of the day’s meetings and conference calls will be scheduled to coincide exactly with halftimes. “We also found that worker output will steadily dwindle through each successive timeout during the second half of close games, with employees unlikely to do more than quickly check their email in the final two minutes. In virtually every office around the country, the bulk of what will be finished today is busywork that will be dashed off during garbage time of a blowout.” The report went on to confirm that the entire U.S. labor force will grind to a complete halt in the event of overtime."
"Report: Gonzaga’s In Washington, Right?","NEW YORK—Ahead of the team’s first-round game against Seton Hall in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, a new report released Thursday revealed that Gonzaga is in Washington state, right? “It’s up right around Seattle, isn’t it?” read the report in part, which went on to speculate that Gonzaga is the name of a town or possibly a Catholic saint. “It’s in the Pacific Northwest, right? Or, wait, it might be in Oregon, actually. Somewhere around there.” Despite confirming Gonzaga’s approximate location, the report went on to reveal that Weber State could be absolutely anywhere."
ew Report Reveals Kentucky Seniors Forced To Endure Brutal Hazing From Freshman Players,"LEXINGTON, KY—In an appalling revelation that has sent shockwaves through the program, multiple reports confirmed Thursday that seniors on this year’s University of Kentucky basketball team were repeatedly subjected to cruel and degrading forms of hazing by the team’s freshman players. “We discovered a number of incidents in which Kentucky’s upperclassmen were forced to carry the squad’s gym bags to and from practice, sit in a locked closet for hours at a time, and consume excessive amounts of alcohol until the point of vomiting,” said NCAA investigator Derek Jones, adding that the humiliating and barbaric rituals were strictly enforced by the team’s first-year players. “This was apparently seen as a way to make the seniors understand their place on the team, but regardless of the reasoning, it is absolutely unacceptable. Several players said they were often frightened for their safety, but felt they had to continue or they would be punished even further by their freshman teammates. Unfortunately, this is a growing trend among top college basketball programs, and it has to be stopped.” Following the report, the University of Kentucky athletic department announced the immediate suspension of all accused players amid an internal investigation, leaving Wildcats coach John Calipari no choice but to field a starting lineup with no freshmen in the NCAA Tournament."
Indianapolis Sports Reporter Pours His Little Heart Out In Peyton Manning Retirement Column,"INDIANAPOLIS—Praising the veteran quarterback as “a man who changed the game of football forever,” Indianapolis Star reporter Kyle Bowman reportedly poured his little heart out Monday in a column about the retirement of Peyton Manning. “I have long dreaded the day when I would finally have to say this goodbye, but let me begin by saying that covering Peyton has been the greatest privilege of my professional life,” read an excerpt of Bowman’s glowing 3,800-word tribute, in which he gushed that Lucas Oil Stadium is “The House That Peyton Built.” “Peyton Manning has meant more to the fans and community here than anyone could ever put into words, and this city owes him a debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished during his 14 years in a Colts uniform. Number 18 will always be our quarterback.” Bowman then finished baring his undying love for Manning by concluding the piece with a single line reading “Thank you, Peyton.”"
Peyton Manning Fondly Recalls When Not Winning Super Bowl Was Most Damaging Part Of Legacy,"DENVER—Amid recent accusations of HGH use and resurfacing sexual assault allegations from his time in college, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning fondly recalled when the most damaging aspect of his legacy was that he had not won a Super Bowl, sources confirmed Monday. “You know, I really miss when the biggest hit to my personal and professional reputation was failing to deliver a championship with the Colts,” said Manning, adding that he now longs for past ridicule that focused exclusively on below-par performances in the playoffs against lower-seeded AFC teams. “Those really were the days, when comparisons to Dan Marino and Charles Barkley were my biggest source of embarrassment, and when the absolute worst things anyone could say about me were that I choke in big games and can’t handle playing in cold weather. Man, what I would give to just go back to that.” Manning added that he took for granted all the years when simply winning a football game was enough to prove that people were wrong about him."
Doctors Recount Difficult Procedure To Separate Conjoined Splash Brothers At Birth,"SAN FRANCISCO—Explaining that the harrowing 27-hour operation only had a 13 percent chance of success, doctors from UCSF Medical Center recalled Thursday the incredibly difficult procedure to separate the conjoined Splash Brothers at birth. “We quickly discovered a bleeding internal vein shared between the two that didn’t appear in our initial 3D imaging, causing us to almost lose Steph right away,” said lead surgeon Robert Pacheco, adding that his 12-doctor team of pediatric surgeons and anesthesiologists worked in shifts to separate the then-newborn Splash Brothers, whose bodies were initially fused from the top of the abdomen to the pelvis. “The most significant complication arose when we realized the two shared a liver and part of the digestive tract, so we had to proceed very cautiously, and fortunately managed to avoid hitting any arteries. Because of the unexpected blood loss early on, we were prepared to lose one or both Splash Brothers, but they fought through the procedure, and thankfully, the two of them made it.” Pacheco added that some kidney damage suffered during the operation caused Steph’s stunted growth, which remains the reason he is still much smaller than Klay."
Peyton Manning Tirelessly Studying Footage Of Athletes Denying Allegations,"DENVER—Praising the 39-year-old’s exhaustive preparations amid accusations involving performance-enhancing drug use and sexual assault, sources close to Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning confirmed Wednesday that he has been tirelessly studying video footage of other athletes denying allegations. “He’ll sit in his film room 10, sometimes 12 hours a day just studying various defenses, and he’s been absolutely meticulous about writing down exactly how many seconds someone pauses before becoming teary-eyed and saying how hard the whole process has been on them and their family,” said Manning’s personal assistant, Ryan Robinson, noting that the quarterback had been thoroughly studying the likes of Kobe Bryant, Barry Bonds, Ben Roethlisberger, and Lance Armstrong, often rewatching their interviews multiple times until he has memorized the techniques they used to profess their innocence. “You can ask him where Roger Clemens’ eyes were each time he says ‘It never happened’ on the 60 Minutes interview about the Mitchell Report, and Peyton can tell you. I swear, he’s got an encyclopedic knowledge of this stuff going back to the 1985 MLB cocaine trials. He’s just so focused and determined to beat the case.” Robinson added that Manning has also been meeting three hours a day with a public-speaking coach to work on the fundamentals of nonverbally conveying disbelief."
Browns Front Office Worried They Completely Botched NFL Combine Interview,"INDIANAPOLIS—Noticeably cringing as he recalled repeatedly stumbling over his questions, Cleveland Browns chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta expressed concern to reporters Tuesday that the team may have completely blown their NFL combine interview with Cal quarterback Jared Goff. “I can’t believe some of the stupid stuff that came out of my mouth—I just got so nervous that I wound up asking all the wrong things,” said DePodesta, adding that the team’s entire front office was anxiously fidgeting throughout the 15-minute meeting. “At one point, I was rambling about how well I thought he would fit into the Browns offense, and then I lost my train of thought, so I just sort of trailed off. I could tell he wasn’t impressed at all. God, I wish we could just do it over again.” DePodesta added that the team likely came off as “totally fake and insincere” while assuring Goff that they have learned from their past mistakes."
Rick Pitino Reminds Players Door To Sex Dungeon Always Open,"LOUISVILLE, KY—Stressing the importance of improving communication between players and the coaching staff, University of Louisville basketball head coach Rick Pitino reminded his players Monday that the door to his sex dungeon is always open. “I just want you guys to know that I’m here to discuss any issues you might be having, so always feel free to come in, take a seat in one of the leather fuck swings, and tell me what’s on your mind,” said Pitino, adding that players can simply pop into his dark, candlelit pleasure lair unannounced if something is bothering them. “I’m usually around pretty late having my nipples clamped while my wrists are shackled to a bedpost, and even if it looks like I’m busy getting flogged and about to blow a huge load, don’t be shy about interrupting me. Whether it’s a concern that you have on the court or just something in your personal life that you want to talk about, I’ll always make time to unzip the ear slits of my black leather hood and hear you out.” At press time, sophomore Cardinals guard Quentin Snider was seen hesitating outside Pitino’s door, unsure whether to knock after hearing loud, piercing screams of ecstasy emanating from within."
"Jaguars, Raiders Hold Postseason Exhibition Game In London","LONDON—In the latest effort by the NFL to expand the sport of football internationally, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Oakland Raiders held a postseason exhibition game Friday at London’s Wembley Stadium. “Today was a fantastic opportunity for the fans in England to see the Jaguars and Raiders play a full game as both teams prepare to head into the offseason,” league commissioner Roger Goodell said of the postseason exhibition, which Jacksonville won 24-21 in overtime in front of a sold-out crowd of 90,000 spectators. “It was a great turnout, and as always, it provided a chance for the teams to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses coming out of the regular season.” Goodell added that, based on the overwhelming success of the overseas matchup, the league is planning to add three more London exhibition games to the postseason schedule."
Powerless Buster Olney Knows Every MLB Team’s Biggest Needs But Can Do Nothing To Address Them,"NEW YORK—Lamenting that he is simply one man among a league of 30 rosters, ESPN baseball analyst Buster Olney expressed frustration Thursday over knowing every MLB team’s biggest offseason needs, yet being utterly powerless to address them. “Tell me: What good is it knowing every team’s biggest hot-stove free-agent targets if I can do nothing to help acquire them?” said Olney, adding that while he can so clearly see which clubs need power hitting, a better starting rotation, or more outfield depth, he is but a helpless bystander, unable to actually deliver real changes to any starting lineup. “Only the Padres can improve their power hitting, and only the Astros can bolster their bullpen. As much as I may want to, I cannot do it for them. Still, though, when I know that without a major upgrade at center field by signing the likes of Denard Span, the Brewers are doomed to finish no higher than fourth place in the NL Central, I feel so utterly helpless. This foresight is no gift—it’s a curse.” Olney went on to say that, despite the urge to step in, he must only watch general managers across the league and simply hope they can do what is necessary to put their teams in playoff contention."
Broncos Follow Super Bowl Parade Route Through Treacherous Rocky Mountain Pass,"ESTES PARK, CO—Following their 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos held a championship parade Tuesday through an icy and treacherous stretch of the Rocky Mountains.The parade, which commenced at Wynkoop Street in downtown Denver and is scheduled to culminate at the 14,440-foot-high summit of Mount Elbert, reportedly attempted to traverse a perilous route along jagged and snow-covered mountain terrain, facing blizzard-like conditions and temperatures that dropped as low as 40 degrees below freezing."
Peyton Manning Declares He Has At Least One More Surgery In Him,"SANTA CLARA, CA—Following his team’s 24-10 win in Super Bowl 50, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning ended weeks of speculation surrounding his future by announcing Sunday that he has at least one more surgery in him. “I’ve had a long run and been a part of a lot of pretty big surgeries, but I still think I’ve got one more major operation left in the tank,” said Manning, adding that he had deliberated for the past six months with friends, family, and medical specialists before deciding that he wasn’t ready to hang up his hospital gown for good. “Ultimately, I have to listen to my body, but I’ll keep going as long as I can still handle the anesthesia. I just can’t imagine myself never being under those bright lights in the operating room again. I’ll get on the gurney one more time and then ride off into the sunset.” Manning refused to comment, however, when asked whether he would undergo his next surgery in Denver or potentially at a medical center in Los Angeles."
Entire Broncos Organization Announces Retirement After Super Bowl Win,"SANTA CLARA, CA—Following the team’s 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50, every single member of the Denver Broncos organization officially announced their retirement Sunday. “To go out on top with a Super Bowl win, there’s no better way to end our time in the league,” read a joint statement released by quarterback Peyton Manning, general manager John Elway, head coach Gary Kubiak, all 22 assistant coaches, every executive in the Broncos’ front office, and every player on the Broncos’ roster, as well as the organization’s trainers, equipment managers, scouting personnel, medical staff, executive assistants, marketing team, IT team, human resources department, receptionists, security guards, and janitors, and the Sports Authority Stadium at Mile High ushers, grounds crew, and food vendors. “It was a tough decision to make, but ultimately, we realized that we’d accomplished everything we set out to do, and we’ve got nothing left to prove. Not many people can say they were able to go out as Super Bowl champs.” At press time, the Broncos had taken out a full-page ad in The Denver Post to say thanks and goodbye to all the fans in the city."
Area Dad Spends Super Bowl Looking Regretfully At Son Who Wasn’t Allowed To Play Football,"WESTERVILLE, OH—Repeatedly glancing away from the television while the rest of his family excitedly watched the game, local father Doug Bryant reportedly spent most of the Super Bowl 50 broadcast Sunday looking regretfully at his 17-year-old son, Alex, who was never allowed to play football. “Some game so far, huh?” said Bryant, clapping his son on the shoulder as they watched the game together, all the while ruefully recalling how he and his wife had refused his son’s requests to play Pop Warner football over the years, thus preventing him from ever discovering a talent for the sport, competing at a high level, and perhaps someday even making it all the way to the Super Bowl himself as a star NFL player. “That was a heck of a play right there. Great catch, and what a throw, too. Just awesome.” Sources also confirmed that at one point during the game, Alex looked over at his father and sadly remembered that the long-term hip and back problems the elder Bryant sustained from playing high school football often made it difficult to play outside while his son was growing up."
Super Bowl Halftime Show Marred By Functioning Sound System,"SANTA CLARA, CA—Disappointing the thousands of fans in attendance as well as an estimated 100 million viewers watching at home, the Super Bowl 50 halftime show was marred Sunday by the stadium’s functioning sound system, sources confirmed. “Right from the beginning, the sound was working normally, and unfortunately, I could clearly hear the singing,” said 29-year-old spectator Joe Kessler, adding that the show’s audio feed, which was amplified throughout the stadium and transmitted to television broadcasts with no technical issues, made the performances by Beyonce, Coldplay, and Bruno Mars completely unbearable. “There was definitely nothing wrong with the speakers or the microphones. It’s a shame, because the perfect sound quality just ruined the whole thing.” Kessler added that he hopes Super Bowl organizers would learn from the incident and avoid a similar disaster next year."
Surviving Members Of First Championship Team Honored During Puppy Bowl Halftime,"NEW YORK—Slowly making their way out to midfield with the assistance of their owners, surviving members of the first Puppy Bowl championship team were honored at Animal Planet Stadium during Sunday’s Kitty Half-Time Show. “Tonight, we are proud to recognize the accomplishments of these iconic legends whose exceptional playfulness on the sport’s cutest stage paved the way for future generations of puppy players,” announcer Dan Schachner said before introducing the aging title-winners—several of whom are now blind or whose hind legs are supported by a wheelchair—and giving each dog a commemorative Puppy Bowl I chew toy. “Of course, no one will ever forget ‘The Fetch’—the defining moment of that first Puppy Bowl and arguably the most adorable play in puppy football history—when Cocoa sniffed out an opposing wagging-tailback in the barkfield, retrieved the plush ball, and took it all the way to the dog house. It is one of the greatest-ever touchdown frolics.” The halftime ceremony reportedly concluded with a special segment in memory of Jack Russell terrier Max, Puppy Bowl I’s Most Valuable Puppy, who was sadly put down in 2015 after battling heartworm for several years."

Thank God he’s okay, but my heart was in my mouth for a few minutes there. He has to be more aware of his surroundings, because next time we might not be so lucky.” At press time, an alert had been issued through the stadium PA system after Manning wandered into the stands and vanished in a dense crowd of fans."
Nervous Peyton Manning Feeling Better After Vomiting Blood Before Game,"SANTA CLARA, CA—Having suffered from intense pregame nerves just 30 minutes before the kickoff of Super Bowl 50, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning confirmed Sunday that he felt much better after throwing up blood in the locker room. “I always get major butterflies right before a big game, so it’s nice to just get it out of my system,” Manning said while wiping smeared blood from around his mouth with a paper towel, having spent over 20 minutes vomiting blood into a toilet until he was left dry-heaving. “It’s good to be nervous, though. This has just become part of my routine over the last few years.” Manning added that he also likes to spend a few minutes hitting a punching bag before each game in order to pump himself up and get the feeling in his arms back."
Area Man Would Hate Cam Newton Even If He Was Different Minority,"MURRAY, KY—Adamantly stressing that his disdain for the 26-year-old quarterback is not based on any racial prejudice toward African Americans, local 49-year-old Michael Willet told reporters Friday that he would hate Cam Newton even if the Carolina Panthers star was a different minority. “I just can’t stand the obnoxious way he plays and how he showboats after every touchdown, and I’d feel that way regardless of whether he was black, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern,” said Willet, adding that Newton having the skin color of any other minority group wouldn’t lessen his intense dislike for the quarterback’s sideline antics and flashy, arrogant demeanor. “The fact that he’s black has nothing to do with it. If he was a Mexican guy dancing all over the field after first downs and posing for the camera, I’d hate him just as much.” Willet added that he would always root against Newton no matter which white quarterback is on the other team."
Wade Phillips Wondering Why Big Egg On Top Of Lombardi Trophy,"SANTA CLARA, CA—Curiously studying the sterling championship trophy ahead of Super Bowl 50, Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips expressed confusion to reporters Thursday over why the Lombardi Trophy has a big silver egg on top of it. “It’s a nice trophy, but I don’t get why there’s a huge egg on it,” said a visibly perplexed Phillips, furrowing his brow and crossing his arms as he wondered aloud whether large eggs were featured in some way during the first Super Bowl. “I don’t get it. Whose idea was it to put an egg on top? It’s a pretty big egg, too—a lot bigger than other eggs—but eggs don’t have anything to do with the Super Bowl. Did Vince Lombardi like eggs? Is that why?” At press time, Phillips was carefully tapping the trophy against the ground in an attempt to crack the egg open."

It wakes me up right away, which is great when I don’t have time for my usual hot blood shower in the morning.” Reports later confirmed that after getting dressed and putting on his shoes, Belichick realized he was late for work and quickly filled a travel mug with some steaming hot blood before rushing out the door."
Bell Tolling Through PA System Portends Doom For Away Team Facing Third Down,"GLENDALE, AZ—Claiming that the haunting din suddenly and without warning filled the air of the 63,000-seat arena, sources confirmed that a bell tolling through the University of Phoenix Stadium’s PA system Thursday night portended certain doom for the visiting Minnesota Vikings as they faced third down. “The bell’s ring—that horrible ring—is this an omen that our time with the ball is soon to end?” uttered fifth-year Vikings right guard Brandon Fusco as the sinister tones reverberated through the stadium speakers, cutting short quarterback Teddy Bridgewater’s play call and casting a chilling silence over the offense, the entire huddle reportedly feeling within their bones the shadowy approach of a failed third-down conversion. “Vile cacophony! O symphony of ruin! The kiss of death for an ill-fated drive, one forever doomed to perish without the necessary seven-yard gain for a first down. Lo, we must heed this telltale sign before it is too late!” At press time, the Vikings had converted the third down."
Mike Pettine Worried Bengals Gave Rest Of League Blueprint To Beat Browns,"CLEVELAND—Following a 37-3 loss that saw his team outperformed in nearly every phase of the game, Cleveland head coach Mike Pettine admitted his growing concern Wednesday that the Cincinnati Bengals may have given the rest of the league the blueprint for beating the Browns. “You know, Cincinnati completely shut down our offense and ran all over our defense, and now I’m worried that other teams are going to be able to study exactly how they did it,” Pettine told reporters, adding that he fears Sunday’s loss may have exposed some of the key weaknesses of his 2-10 team. “The Bengals totally figured us out. Any team that wants to know how to establish a passing rhythm against us or get to our quarterback will be able to figure it out just by watching the game tape from last week. It’s definitely a big problem moving forward.” Pettine went on to express some confidence that even if the Browns’ upcoming opponents attempt to recreate the Bengals’ game plan, most teams will hopefully lack the personnel to slow down their 32nd-ranked run game."

Thank you.” At press time, university officials had declined to comment on newly circulating rumors that Saban will opt to wear a white long-sleeve shirt under the Alabama polo shirt if it is chilly out on Saturday afternoon."
Greg Hardy Assures Tony Romo He’s Seen Ex-Girlfriends Come Back From Far Worse Injuries,"DALLAS—In an effort to comfort the recovering quarterback after a broken collarbone sidelined him for the season, Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy reportedly assured Tony Romo Wednesday that he has seen plenty of ex-girlfriends come back from far more serious injuries. “I know you’re feeling down right now, but listen, I’ve seen exes make full recoveries after being in much worse shape than you, trust me,” said Hardy, promising that if his last three girlfriends were all able to get back to normal following months of extensive physical therapy, there was no way a hairline fracture would keep Romo out for long. “I remember a girlfriend in college who got hurt really bad—Amanda actually ended up needing surgery—but she powered through it and eventually regained all the mobility in her shoulder. Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right?” At press time, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had praised Hardy as “a fantastic teammate” and offered the defensive lineman a new five-year, $89 million contract."
Area Dad Thinks Refs Should Just Let Them Play Football,"DOYLESTOWN, PA—Facetiously questioning how the game had suddenly become a non-contact sport, local father Aaron Harper confirmed his belief Thursday that referees officiating a Thanksgiving game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Detroit Lions should just let them play football out there. “How are you going to penalize a guy for a clean play like that?” said the visibly irked 53-year-old, adding that the officials are ruining the game by making a big deal out of every little push and shove they see. “If you can’t take a hit, then you shouldn’t be on the field. This isn’t soccer—these guys need to drop the whistle for two seconds and let them play the damn game.” Harper was reportedly later overheard yelling that a player undergoing the league’s mandatory concussion protocol needs to “just walk it off and get back out there.”"
Punter Just Praying Returner Doesn’t Make It All The Way To Him,"JACKSONVILLE, FL—Growing increasingly nervous as he contemplated being the team’s last line of defense, Tennessee Titans punter Brett Kern was reportedly praying Thursday that Jacksonville Jaguars returner Rashad Greene wouldn’t make it all the way down the field to him. “For the love of God, someone—anyone—please, just tackle him,” said Kern, pleading for some kind of divine intervention to stop the oncoming runner as he began weaving in and out of defenders and making his way up the sideline. “Christ, why didn’t I just kick it out of bounds? Maybe if I start running over in that direction, someone will just block me. Fuck, Marqueston [Huff] just missed a tackle on him. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.” At press time, Kern’s mind went blank and a sudden wave of adrenaline rushed through his body as he lowered his head and delivered a fierce hit that knocked Greene out of bounds at the 15-yard line."
Aging Peyton Manning Now Forced To Take Field With Assistance Dog,"DENVER—Noting that he is no longer capable of safely maneuvering across the field on his own, the Denver Broncos announced Tuesday that quarterback Peyton Manning will now be accompanied in all games by a specially trained assistance dog. “Given Peyton’s age and physical limitations, he needs Scout to help him navigate the pocket and find his way to and from the huddle,” said head coach Gary Kubiak, adding that the 2-year-old Labrador retriever—who the veteran quarterback will have on a leash at all times when stepping into the backfield—can recognize all of Manning’s voice commands and hand signals at the line of scrimmage and will then carefully guide him through a play accordingly. “Scout will make sure Peyton can move around slowly and securely without falling down or running into one of his offensive linemen, and he’s trained to bark if there’s a defender blitzing Peyton’s blind side. Not only is he a guide and helper, but he’s also a companion, and they’ve already become great friends.” Kubiak added that he has already had to tell younger Broncos players that they are prohibited from petting Scout during games in order to avoid distracting the canine and risking Manning being seriously injured."
Defensive Tackle’s Innocence Shattered By Play-Action Pass,"EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ—Saying the eye-opening experience has forever altered his worldview, Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Marcell Dareus admitted to reporters Friday that a play-action pass play by the New York Jets had totally shattered his youthful innocence. “I saw Ryan [Fitzpatrick] complete the handoff, so I immediately tackled the running back, only to find out that he didn’t even have the ball—it was all just a lie,” said Dareus, adding that watching the runner mimic carrying the ball as the quarterback dropped back to pass made him finally realize the truly terrible, deceitful things that players are capable of behind the line of scrimmage. “You go through your whole life thinking that everything is simple, that people are good, that a run play is a run play and a pass play is a pass play. But you know what? That’s not the world we live in. Seeing that really forced me to grow up—and I’ll never be the same again.” Shortly after the play, Dareus was spotted removing his helmet and walking off the field in the middle of a crucial third-and-short, muttering under his breath that there is no God."

I love you.” Sources confirmed that before exiting the room, Goodell took one last look at the empty tank intended for Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, emitted a deep sigh, and then shut the door."
Bulls Players Annoyed By Derrick Rose Always Leaving Torn Ligaments All Over Locker Room,"CHICAGO—Calling it “disrespectful” and “totally disgusting,” members of the Chicago Bulls expressed their frustration to reporters Wednesday over point guard Derrick Rose’s habit of always leaving his torn ligaments strewn all over their locker room. “Every time I walk in here after practice or a game, I see Derrick’s shredded MCLs and ACLs just lying on the floor, and it’s ridiculous,” said small forward Jimmy Butler, who added that he and his teammates have repeatedly implored Rose to clean up the wet, tattered bands of connective tissue that he regularly leaves sitting in puddles of synovial fluid around nearby lockers. “Not only is it gross, but yesterday Pau [Gasol] threw out one that he almost slipped on in the bathroom. They’re Derrick’s ligaments, so we shouldn’t have to pick up after him like this. We’re sick of it.” Butler added that he and his teammates have also spoken to Rose about his chunks of knee cartilage that routinely clog the facility’s shower drains."
Royals Prove Doubters Who Were Still Paying Attention Wrong,"NEW YORK—Having capped off their championship run with a 7-2 victory over the New York Mets in Game 5 Sunday night, members of the Kansas City Royals expressed their delight at silencing the doubters who still happened to be paying any attention to the World Series. “It feels pretty great to finally shut up all the naysayers who actually continued following the postseason to this point,” said Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer, adding that the team rallied in the face of critics who—unlike the majority of baseball fans who immediately lost interest in the playoffs after the Yankees, Cubs, Cardinals, Pirates, and Dodgers were eliminated—claimed that the team would be easily swept by the surging Mets. “We heard it all: ‘The Royals don’t have enough star power to go all the way’; ‘Kansas City can’t compete with the big-market teams’; ‘Nobody gives a shit about the World Series this year or which team wins.’ But you know what, we never bought into that stuff. We always believed we could do it, and our win tonight speaks for itself.” Hosmer went on to say that the Royals’ World Series victory proved to the small number of Americans who still enjoy watching baseball that anything is possible."
Team Of Bikini-Clad Women Tend To Injured Dez Bryant In Cowboys’ Rehabilitation Grotto,"DALLAS—Providing injured players with the very best in amenities, individualized training programs, and exotic Mediterranean fruits, a team of bikini-clad women tended to injured wide receiver Dez Bryant in the Dallas Cowboys’ state-of-the-art rehabilitation grotto, team sources confirmed Thursday. “This place is amazing—I’ve got access to top-of-the-line PT equipment, and I’ve been working really closely with Candi on plyometric strengthening exercises so I can get back on the field as quickly as possible,” said Bryant, sipping on a flute of champagne while several tanned, scantily dressed female trainers carefully stretched his hamstrings. “Lately, it’s just been Tony [Romo] and me swimming laps in the lily pond every morning, and I usually lie out on those sun-bathed limestone rocks and use the electrical muscle stimulation machine to recover after my workouts. Oh, and the private massage area behind the waterfall is really out of this world.” At press time, a group of giggling, topless women had emerged from the rehabilitation grotto’s hot spring after finishing their daily afternoon appointment with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones."

The shadows…the shadows are my home.” At press time, Pierre-Paul was feasting on a bucket of raw fish left for him near a drainage grate by Giants head coach Tom Coughlin."
Aging Charles Woodson Keeps Asking To Turn Up Sideline’s Heaters,"SAN DIEGO—Estimating the temperature near the bench to be at least 85 degrees, both players and coaches on the Oakland Raiders expressed their frustration Sunday over veteran safety Charles Woodson repeatedly asking to turn up the heaters on the sideline. “It must be 70 degrees out right now, but he keeps complaining about how nippy it is and asking to bring the heaters closer to him,” said Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper, adding that Woodson has also been wrapping himself in blankets on the bench in order to avoid “catching a chill.” “And if we don’t turn the heat up right away, he keeps coughing and looking at us to get our attention. This is ridiculous—we’re all sweating our asses off out here.” At press time, Woodson had told teammates that it was simply too drafty out and went back into the locker room."
Jim Harbaugh Starts Off Day With Early Morning Sprint Through Ann Arbor,"ANN ARBOR, MI—Explaining that it’s a great way to fit some daily exercise into his otherwise incredibly hectic schedule, University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh reportedly started his day off Friday by taking an early morning sprint through Ann Arbor. “I’ve been doing this for years—it’s a great way to get your day going,” said Harbaugh, who begins every day by waking up at 6:30 a.m., putting on his running shoes, and sprinting at full speed for the entire duration of a six-mile run through various neighborhoods near his home. “I like coming out here right around dawn, since no one else is really awake at that hour and the air is so crisp. It really gets the blood flowing.” Harbaugh added that he always likes to finish every run strong by screaming at the top of his lungs for the last half mile."

McCray due to the incredibly treacherous turf conditions at Levi’s Stadium. “It’s way too dangerous out there, and, unfortunately, we just can’t risk putting our staff in harm’s way in order to get to L.J.,” said athletic trainer Manny Rivera, explaining that his medical team had initially attempted to make their way to McCray’s position, but were forced to turn back halfway upon seeing the hazardous, totally uneven playing surface firsthand. “This is a decision that no one would ever want to make, but the last thing we need is to have more people potentially trapped out there as well. Sadly, L.J. is on his own now, and all we can do is pray that he makes it out alive.” At press time, emergency crews were scrambling after a sinkhole suddenly opened on the 15-yard line and swallowed the entire 49ers secondary."
No One In Gym Class Volleyball Game Willing To Set Ball,"LITTLE ELM, TX—With neither team having completed more than two hits during a rally before sending the ball back over the net, sources confirmed Wednesday that no one in Jefferson High School’s third-period gym class was willing to set during a volleyball game. “If the ball comes to me, I don’t care where I am on the court or who’s around me—I’m either spiking it or bumping it really high into the air,” said sophomore Elliot Wahl, echoing the sentiments of every one of his classmates, none of whom had set a single ball for a teammate at any point during the 45-minute game. “I basically just want to be right at the net so I can jump up and smash it as hard as I can. That’s all I want to do right now.” At press time, teams had rotated positions for the third consecutive time after another student attempted an acrobatic jump serve and slammed the ball directly into the net."

NBA Cares Program Sends Chicago Bulls Players To Spend Time At Hospital Visiting Derrick Rose,"CHICAGO—Noting that the charitable gesture has done wonders for his general mood and energy levels, officials from the NBA Cares program confirmed that several members of the Chicago Bulls made a surprise visit to a local hospital Wednesday to spend time with Derrick Rose. “The look on Derrick’s face when Joakim Noah and Jimmy Butler walked into his hospital room and gave him a couple of high-fives—you could just tell it meant the world to him,” said program spokesperson Liz Ventura, explaining that numerous players have taken trips to the hospital to sign autographs and take pictures with Rose, often staying with him for over an hour. “The poor guy has been stuck in that bed for such a long time, so having the Bulls come by and play some NBA 2K16 with him is absolutely the highlight of his week. Pau Gasol has actually visited a couple of times, and Derrick still never wants to take off the jersey he gave him. The best part is that afterwards, he’s so much more upbeat about his treatment. It’s really a blessing.” Ventura noted, however, that several doctors have privately asked Bulls players to avoid getting Rose’s hopes up by assuring him he will make a full recovery."
Girlfriend Can Tell Man Bullshitting Way Through Explanation Of Pass Interference Call,"BURNSVILLE, MN—Admitting that she was confused as to why a flag had been thrown during the previous play, local woman Hannah Larson confirmed Sunday that it was blatantly obvious that her boyfriend, Nick Morris, was just bullshitting his way through an explanation of the referee’s pass interference call. “At first, he said the corner was holding the other guy’s jersey, but then he started going on about how you’re not allowed to touch the receiver past the line of scrimmage until the ball is in the air,” said Larson, adding that she could immediately tell Morris was full of shit as soon as she asked him to further clarify, at which point he vaguely noted that the team was lucky not to get called for an illegal shift as well. “I pressed him on it a little bit, and he repeated verbatim what the commentator had just said about the defender not looking at the ball as he made contact with the receiver. Then he sort of trailed off and mumbled something about hands to the face. He has no idea what the fuck he’s talking about.” At press time, Morris was sitting quietly after officials had picked up the flag and announced that there was no penalty on the play."
Jim Caldwell Provides Lions Players With Printouts Of Inspiring Halftime Speech,"DETROIT—As the Detroit Lions entered the locker room Sunday following the first half of their game against the Chicago Bears, head coach Jim Caldwell reportedly provided every player with a three-page printout of an inspiring halftime speech. “Everyone, please take one,” Caldwell told players as he handed out copies of a 1,400-word, single-spaced motivational locker-room address, titled “Halftime Speech 10/18/15,” which had various words and phrases bolded or underlined for emphasis. “You have approximately 12 minutes to read it before the third quarter starts.

He even dipped everyone’s socks in goat’s blood before last night’s game, and then after we won, he said he had to go blow up a goat in his backyard to make sure we clinch the series. This man needs help.” At press time, sources confirmed that the Wrigley Field grounds crew was scrambling to remove a decapitated goat dangling from the right field Jumbotron before Game 4 of the NLDS."

I might just have to move to a studio or someplace on the South Side, because there’s no way I’m asking my parents for money again.” At press time, a despondent Delle Donne was reportedly dragging a couple kitchen chairs into the living room to replace the futon that her roommate had taken with her."
Furious Rick Pitino Adamant Media Trying To Tarnish Name Of Great Escort Service,"LOUISVILLE, KY—Following the publication of a book alleging that a member of the school’s basketball department paid women to perform sex acts for recruits, furious University of Louisville head coach Rick Pitino told reporters Wednesday that the media was trying to tarnish the name of a great escort service. “No one, I repeat no one, in the Cardinals community has anything but good things to say about these ladies, and it’s absolutely shameful to see their names get dragged through the mud,” said an enraged Pitino, blasting news outlets for maliciously attacking the reputation of a highly regarded, hardworking escort service. “To say I’m disgusted and disappointed with the way the press has recklessly tried to cast aspersions on this escort service would be an understatement. Say what you will about me, I’m the coach of this team, but I won’t stand for the media smearing these women and the outstanding services they provide.” Pitino added that he was confident the university’s independent investigation would find grounds for legal action against members of the press for defamation of the escort service’s character. "
Jerry West Reveals He Is Also Inspiration For MLB Logo,"LOS ANGELES—Admitting that his iconic physical form had an influence far beyond the NBA, former Lakers guard Jerry West revealed to reporters Thursday that he is also the inspiration for the Major League Baseball logo. “People think my nickname is ‘The Logo’ just because of the NBA, but the silhouette in the MLB logo is actually based on my batting stance,” said West, noting that graphic designer Jerry Dior created the MLB logo after once seeing the NBA Hall of Famer play baseball in 1968, with his body posture since becoming a classic symbol of the sport around the world. “If you ever watch the PGA Tour, that’s my golf swing in their logo, and the ATP used an old photo of me during a weekend tennis match to make their logo as well. The NFL logo isn’t based on me, but it is based on an old decorative shield I used to have hanging in my house.” West added that of all the logos that use his likeness, the one he feels most captures his essence as an athlete is that of the X Games."
"Quarterback Better Snap The Ball, Reports Man Nervously Eyeing Play Clock","MANSFIELD, OH—Frantically shifting his gaze between the field and play clock as the seconds wound down, local 34-year-old football fan Isaac Collins announced Sunday that the quarterback better hurry the hell up and snap the ball. “C’mon, only eight seconds left—what are you waiting for?” said Collins, carefully eyeing the small play clock graphic in the corner of the screen as the quarterback ran up to the line of scrimmage to call an audible. “Go already! Go!” At press time, Collins had unleashed a stream of expletives after the quarterback finally snapped the ball to a flurry of whistles and penalty flags."
Wild-Eyed Jim Harbaugh Informs Players They Must Kill Their Pregame Meal,"ANN ARBOR, MI—Stressing the importance of physical and mental preparation for their upcoming game against UNLV, a wild-eyed, frenzied Jim Harbaugh reportedly informed all University of Michigan players Saturday that they would have to kill their pregame meal themselves. “You have four hours to track, catch, and slaughter your food before kickoff,” Harbaugh said during a 7 a.m. team meeting, adding that any tools or weapons must be crafted from materials found in the wilderness, otherwise players would have to use their bare hands. “Skipping the pregame meal is not an option. Those who do not catch their meal will not eat.” At press time, deliriously starving Michigan starting quarterback Jake Rudock had tackled an elk and ripped its throat out before frantically feasting on its meat."
Mike Florio Loses 3 Fingers After Accident While Working At ProFootballTalk Rumor Mill,"BRIDGEPORT, WV—Noting that the 50-year-old was in stable condition after the grisly injury, sources confirmed Friday that veteran sportswriter Mike Florio lost three fingers on his right hand following an accident while working in the ProFootballTalk Rumor Mill. “Mike was trying to extract some new information about the injury status of Drew Brees, and his hand just wound up getting caught in the gears,” said foreman Tom Gibson, adding that emergency workers were forced to shut down the entire Rumor Mill for three hours in order to free Florio’s arm before rushing him to the hospital. “We have a pretty strict safety protocol, but the heavy steel machinery churns out gossip about players’ contract negotiations so quickly and across so many platforms that all it takes is one moment of carelessness for someone to get hurt. Mike is still a little shaken up—he almost went into shock after seeing his severed index finger get crushed inside the apparatus that breaks news on coaching changes—but honestly, he’s lucky he didn’t lose his whole hand.” Gibson confirmed that the accident was the Rumor Mill’s worst since 2011, when a spark caused a massive explosion that tragically killed 12 anonymous league sources."
Dolphins Coaches Trying To Fix Ndamukong Suh’s Quarterback-Throwing Mechanics,"MIAMI—With the star defensive tackle struggling considerably in the first two weeks of the season, Miami Dolphins coaches told reporters Wednesday that they have been working closely with Ndamukong Suh to fix his quarterback-throwing mechanics. “Watching tape of him the past couple weeks, we’ve noticed Ndamukong hasn’t had his usual strength and accuracy, so we’re working with him to get back to the fundamentals of throwing the quarterback,” said Dolphins defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle, adding that Suh has had trouble with his release, often using an elongated sidearm motion that causes him to badly underthrow the quarterback downward and into the ground. “One of the big things we’re focusing on is his footwork, which has been pretty sloppy. We need him firmly planting his feet so he can really step into the throw, which will help put a lot more zip and distance on the quarterback.” Team sources later confirmed that Dolphins coaches were pleased after Suh precisely set his feet, extended his arm all the way in a crisp follow-through, and tossed practice squad quarterback Logan Thomas in a perfect spiral into the end zone."
New LSU Stadium Shuttle Transports Tigers Fans Back To Woods,"BATON ROUGE, LA—Saying that they hope to make traveling to and from football games more convenient and enjoyable, officials from the LSU athletic department announced Friday that the university will now offer a round-trip stadium shuttle bus to transport Tigers fans back to the woods. “Beginning this Saturday, for just $2 a ticket, fans can use our new Tiger Bus to ride directly from the bushlands to the game and back,” said LSU spokesman Michael Bonnette, adding that, beginning six hours before kickoff, fans can catch the bus at any of the numerous stops it will make at various ravines, forest clearings, and swamps near Baton Rouge, while return trips to the remote wilderness will begin at the start of the game’s fourth quarter. “The Tiger Bus is the perfect way to skip the hassle of the parking lot, and helps ensure that all of our fans get back to the far reaches of the forest safely. Shuttles will depart every 15 minutes in order to avoid overcrowding, though the last bus to the backwoods leaves approximately three hours after the game ends, so fans who miss that will have to find other means to return to their tents.” Bonnette added that the athletic department also plans on designating a section of the stadium parking lot for those traveling in on fanboats."
Giants Move Tom Coughlin To Assisted-Coaching Facility,"EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ—Saying that they held off taking such a drastic step for as long as they could, officials from the New York Giants confirmed Wednesday that the team had made the difficult decision to move head coach Tom Coughlin into an assisted-coaching facility. “We know Tom likes his independence, but ultimately we had no choice—at least this way he won’t have to completely stop what he loves doing while still getting the proper supervision and attention he needs,” said offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo, adding that he was hopeful the 69-year-old Coughlin would grow to appreciate the center’s many amenities, including trained staff on-site 24 hours per day ready to help residents read playbooks, review game film, and manage the clock during the fourth quarter. “We all knew this day would eventually come, and even though he was definitely a little hesitant about it, we think it’s for the best. Honestly, it’s a huge relief knowing that there are caretakers always around just in case, God forbid, something awful happens when Tom is trying to call some plays in the middle of a game.” Sources at the facility later confirmed that Giants quarterback Eli Manning has thus far been the only player to have visited Coughlin."
NASCAR Driver Always Forgets Which Side Of Car Gas Tank On,"INDIANAPOLIS—Noting that he had already made the same mistake during his last three pit stops, NASCAR driver Martin Truex Jr. expressed frustration Sunday after once again forgetting which side of his car the gas tank is on. “Goddammit, I do this every time,” said Truex, carefully watching for other cars driving past him at 200 miles per hour as he attempted to perform a three-point turn in the middle of the speedway. “My old No. 56 car had it on the left side—why the hell don’t they just put them all on the same side for every car? Screw it, I’m just going to go all the way around the track and then come back in the right way.” At press time, Truex’s pit crew was quietly waiting next to the car while he repeatedly jiggered the lever below his seat in an attempt to pop open the gas tank door."
Panicking Tom Brady Unable To Stop Smirking Since Suspension Overturned,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—A full week after a federal judge overturned his four-game NFL suspension, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady noted with alarm Wednesday that he has been physically unable to stop smirking since the court’s ruling. “I was obviously really happy when I heard the judge’s decision, but it’s seven days later and all the muscles in my face are still just stuck like this,” said Brady, grinning at reporters with visible fear and panic in his eyes. “Yesterday, my wife came home upset about something that had happened earlier, and I physically could not stop smirking the whole time she was talking. Even now, I’m trying with every ounce of my strength to just stop smiling, and I can’t. I don’t know what to do—please, God, someone help me.” At press time, after several hours of uncomfortable tossing and turning in bed, Brady had finally fallen asleep with a pained smirk still frozen on his face."
Tailgaters Playing Sad Little Game Of Pickup Football In Stadium Parking Lot,"HOUSTON—Noting that the group has been constantly interrupted by cars slowly driving through searching for open spots, onlookers confirmed Saturday that several Texas A&M tailgaters outside NRG Stadium are playing a pathetic little game of pickup football in the parking lot. “Everyone’s just trying to walk to the game, but you have to pass this sideshow of these guys playing a mini–touch football game and then listen to one of them count down from five before blitzing the quarterback,” said 31-year-old Alex Bennett, adding that the seven middle-aged men—most of whom are wearing football jerseys and khaki shorts—are attempting to play a three-on-four game in the space between rows of parked cars. “They barely have enough room to play, so basically if they complete one pass, it’s a touchdown. And one of them accidentally hit the hood of a car with the football, which isn’t that surprising since they look like they’re each a few beers deep. Oh, and look, now they’re bringing in one of their little kids to even up the numbers. Christ.” At press time, the pitiful little spectacle had thankfully come to an end as one of their group’s girlfriends informed them that the burgers on the grill were ready to eat."
"‘Fourth Quarter, Time Winding Down, Super Bowl,’ Report Nation’s 11-Year-Olds","WASHINGTON—In a unified message coming from thousands of backyards, living rooms, parks, and playgrounds, 11-year-olds across the country announced Friday that it’s the fourth quarter with time winding down in the Super Bowl. “Down by three, 10 seconds to go—can he do it?” said the nation’s 11-year-olds, all of whom grimaced with concentration while holding a football forward with both hands. “There’s the snap. He’s back to pass, he dodges a tackle, dodges another one, throws the ball, and—touchdown! The crowd goes wild! Super Bowl champions!” At press time, after cupping their hands around their mouths and simulating the sounds of fans cheering, the 11-year-olds had reportedly grabbed their footballs from the ground and were heard muttering, “Down by three, 10 seconds to go…” as they wound up to go again."
"Naked, Dripping Wet Tom Brady Thrilled By Judge’s Decision To Overturn Suspension, Imagines Judge","NEW YORK—Celebrating his legal victory as fresh steam swirled around his bare body, a naked, dripping wet Tom Brady was absolutely thrilled with the decision to overturn his four-game suspension, the imagination of federal judge Richard Berman confirmed Thursday. “He was so excited when he first heard the news in the middle of a long, hot shower, his strong fingers slowly running down the side of his taut, soapy abs while thinking about my verdict,” noted Berman’s fantasy, adding that several droplets of water gradually trickled down Brady’s glistening chest all the way to his toned pelvic muscles, where they hung so tantalizingly just below his waist. “Look at those biceps ripple as he reaches out from the curtain to grab a towel to rub himself down with. His moist, pink tongue caresses the top row of his perfect teeth before the name ‘Judge Berman’ quietly leaves those soft, supple lips, and then he shuts his eyes and slides one finger in and out of his mouth. He’s so tired, but the case is over now. It’s time to relax, Tom. Mmm, yes.” At press time, Berman’s imagination reported that Brady had just informed his wife, Gisele, that he is leaving her."
Linda Cohn Finds Tim Kurkjian’s Design For Baseball Card Of Himself In Office Printer,"BRISTOL, CT—While looking to retrieve several pages of research notes for an upcoming broadcast of SportsCenter, ESPN anchor Linda Cohn confirmed Thursday that she found what appeared to be Tim Kurkjian’s design for a baseball card of himself sitting in the office printer. “He clearly cut his head out from another photo and put it over a player’s body, and it looks like he just made the whole thing with text boxes on Microsoft Word,” said Cohn, adding that the double-sided, full-color printout portrayed Kurkjian as a shortstop for the New York Yankees with 260 home runs and a .277 batting average. “He copy and pasted the Topps logo on the back, and he even included this little bio that talks about his off-field hobbies and refers to him as ‘a true five-tool player.’ I’m going to do him a favor and just toss this before anyone else sees it.” At press time, Kurkjian was anxiously walking around the ESPN offices and asking if anyone had picked up anything of his with their printouts by mistake."
Jayson Werth Catches Foul Ball Without Spilling Beer,"WASHINGTON—In an incredible play that drew cheers from the whole stadium, Washington Nationals left fielder Jayson Werth managed to catch a foul ball Tuesday night without spilling the beer he was holding in his other hand. “I saw it come off the bat, and I was like, oh man, it’s coming right toward me,” said Werth, adding that he didn’t have time to put down his clear plastic cup of Miller Lite before the ball reached him. “I hadn’t really been paying attention before that, so it was a good thing I looked up. It was just an instinctive reaction more than anything else. I’m just glad I didn’t get beer all over my new jersey.” Werth added that, while his feat was impressive, it pales in comparison to Brandon Crawford catching a foul ball earlier this season while holding his baby."
Journeyman Fan Joins Sixth NFL Team In 5 Years,"HELENA, MT—Continuing his lengthy trek around the league, sources confirmed Friday that 36-year-old journeyman fan Brian Ferretti has joined the Arizona Cardinals, his sixth team in the past five years. “Brian has really bounced around the NFL over the last decade, but I think he’s finally found the right fit with the Cards, and hopefully he’ll stay with them from here on out,” said coworker Tom Murray, adding that Ferretti’s recent teams include the San Francisco 49ers, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, Baltimore Ravens, and most recently the Seattle Seahawks, who he joined right before the 2013 playoffs. “I think he saw the potential of the Cardinals offense this year under a healthy Carson Palmer and decided they were the right team for him. That said, he’s moved a lot from team to team—I mean, he started out with the Cowboys in the ’90s—so given his history and reputation, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s wearing a different jersey by the middle of the season.” Murray added that this will be Ferretti’s second stint with the Cardinals, having already been with the team briefly for one season in 2008."
Majority Of NFL Players Say They Wouldn’t Let Their Son Play Preseason Football,"NEW YORK—As concerns about the health risks involved for youth players continue to rise, a new poll revealed Thursday that a growing majority of NFL players would not allow their sons to play preseason football. “Now that we know how dangerous it really is, how could I in good conscience let my 7-year-old son go out there and play in a preseason football game?” said Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons, echoing the sentiments of many NFL players who told reporters that the potentially devastating health costs associated with participating in a full four-game preseason outweigh any reward, especially at the professional level. “The fact of the matter is that we just didn’t understand the full risks of preseason football back when I first started playing. I love this sport, but I’m not going to let my child put his long-term health on the line just to play football every week in August.” Timmons added that he was already encouraging his son to focus on basketball or soccer until regular-season football gets underway."
Chiefs Rookies Forced To Lug Andy Reid’s Snacks To And From Practice,"ST. JOSEPH, MO—Saying that the daily ritual has been both physically and mentally draining, rookies on the Kansas City Chiefs confirmed Monday that they have been forced to carry all of head coach Andy Reid’s snacks to and from practice every day. “It’s brutal—this morning, I had to lug 80-pound duffel bags filled with spicy beef jerky and cream-filled cupcakes while running to the field,” said first-year offensive lineman Mitch Morse, adding that he is often sore before practice even starts, having arrived an hour early to haul 10-gallon gravy jugs to the sideline. “I know all the new players have to do it—Knile Davis told me he almost hurt his shoulder while carrying coach’s hickory-smoked summer sausages back in 2013—but it still feels cruel and overboard.” At press time, rookie cornerback Marcus Peters was running laps as punishment for bringing Reid a tray of chili-cheese nachos without any sour cream."
Entire Ruby Tuesday Waitstaff Just Trying To Ignore Table Holding Fantasy Football Draft,"SUFFOLK, VA—Hoping to have as little contact as possible with the large group of college-aged men until they left the restaurant, every member of the waitstaff at a local Ruby Tuesday admitted Friday that they were actively avoiding a large table conducting their fantasy football draft. “I got their food and drink orders all in one swoop and then booked it back to the kitchen before they could ask for anything else—as soon as I drop off these buffalo wings, I’m staying away from them at all costs,” said server Heather Lipscomb, adding that she brought two extra pitchers of beer for the 10 men—several of whom were wearing NFL jerseys—in the hopes that they wouldn’t need anything else for the rest of the night. “One of them kept waving at me as I was bringing some entrées over to another table in my section, but I just kept my head down and pretended I didn’t notice, and everyone else working tonight is pretty much treating that whole area as a no-fly zone. Look, they already have their little draft printouts and laptops spread all over the two tables that [hostess] Melissa had to push together for them—God, I hate them.” At press time, after successfully ignoring them for a full hour, several waiters audibly groaned upon overhearing that the group was only just about to start their draft."
Jason Witten Can’t Believe He Stuck Rooming With Jerry Jones During Training Camp Again,"OXNARD, CA—Saying that he is counting down the days until the offseason practices are over, Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten told reporters Thursday that he can’t believe he was once again stuck sharing a hotel room with owner Jerry Jones during training camp. “Goddammit, this is the fifth straight year they’ve paired us together,” said Witten, explaining that he has come to dread returning to his room each afternoon to find Jones sitting on his bed drinking bottles of Michelob Ultra and watching television at its maximum volume. “He never picks up any of his dirty clothes or trash—Christ, just look at all these copies of Maxim around the room. Plus, when I’m trying to go to sleep at night, all he wants to do is talk about that day’s practice and what the team should be working on before the season starts. I’m so fucking sick of him.” At press time, Witten was quietly reading a book in the hotel lounge after an intoxicated Jones had barged into their room with a woman on each arm."
Redskins Maintain They Were Legally Granted Right To Name By 1807 Treaty Of Blackwater Creek,"WASHINGTON—Responding to widespread criticism from an increasing majority of Americans who find the team’s moniker offensive, Washington Redskins officials announced Wednesday that they were legally granted the right to use the name by the 1807 Treaty of Blackwater Creek. “What critics fail to understand is that the Redskins name was originally approved by Native American tribes in an effort to make peace with early settlers,” said franchise owner Daniel Snyder, explaining that the 19th-century Iroquois gave their blessing to use the Redskins logo in exchange for bolts of cloth, copper kettles, and various food supplies. “Our team’s identity is not only a source of pride for our players, coaches, and fans, but also symbolizes a promise we made over two centuries ago at Fort Elmsley. To abandon it now would simply dishonor all the distinguished Native American elders who came together at Blackwater Creek and helped forge that great and historic concord.” Snyder added that the treaty also contained a provision in which all Native American tribes agreed that no future U.S. government agency could ever revoke the Washington Redskins’ trademark protection."
NFL To Prohibit Family Members From Delivering Speeches At Players’ Funerals,"NEW YORK—Stressing that the new policy would be effective immediately, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Tuesday that the league will strictly prohibit family members from delivering remarks at players’ funerals. “After careful consideration, we have determined that eulogies for players who have passed away will no longer be given by family and friends,” said Goodell, adding that an NFL representative will instead issue a brief eight- to 10-minute speech honoring the deceased as the coffin is lowered into the ground. “Family will be allowed to stand next to the gravestone during the tribute, but will not be permitted to deliver any additional comments to the crowd of mourners. Should they wish to be more involved, however, the next of kin are welcome to read a spiritual passage or lead the service in a prayer, provided they are selected from our list of acceptable options.” Goodell also confirmed that all epitaphs must be submitted to the league for final approval, while cemetery plots will be restricted to flowers and a single black-and-white photograph of the late player smiling in his team uniform."
Fan Can’t Believe He Left 11 Seconds Into Ronda Rousey Fight,"RIO DE JANEIRO—Kicking himself for not staying all the way until the end of the fight and subsequently missing its thrilling finish, local mixed martial arts fan Marcos Acosta expressed both disappointment and regret Tuesday for leaving UFC 190’s main event between Ronda Rousey and Bethe Correia after 11 seconds. “The first five or six seconds were pretty boring, so I decided to just head out of the arena a bit early so I could beat the traffic,” a visibly disappointed Acosta told reporters, noting that the bout’s unexciting first tenth of a minute had produced little more than some jostling and light jabs, so he simply assumed that the rest of the fight would be just as uneventful. “I had no idea I would end up missing such a crazy knockout right after that. God, I’m such an idiot.” Acosta further lamented that he was not among the lucky spectators who began leaving their seats around the 25th second, yet turned around upon hearing the crowd’s reaction and managed to see the fight’s conclusion."
Fan Bravely Ventures To Other Side Of Stadium In Search Of Better Food Options,"CINCINNATI—Fearlessly embarking on a journey to areas as far as the outer mezzanine, local Cincinnati Reds fan Tony Amico, 38, reportedly departed from his section at Great American Ball Park Friday and trekked all the way to the other side of the stadium in search of better food options. “I’m pretty hungry, but all they have around here are hot dogs and nachos, and I don’t really feel like either of those,” Amico told reporters as he began his long and arduous odyssey past 23 different seating sections in the concourse, holding out hope of coming across pizza or perhaps even some barbecue. “I saw a guy walk past with some tacos, but I have no idea where he got them from. I could have sworn I saw a place with pulled pork sliders while we were walking up to our seats, too—I could definitely go for that.” At press time, Amico had finally reached the promised land after discovering a concession stand selling chicken tenders, but ultimately opted to return to his seat empty-handed after learning that they cost $12."
"‘Some Of This Is Probably Water,’ Man In Stadium Bathroom Hopes","CLEVELAND—Gingerly stepping around several of the largest wet patches on the floor, local Indians fan Mark Freel reportedly assured himself Tuesday that at least some of the liquid covering the ground of the men’s bathroom at Progressive Field was most likely water. “It’s probably just water from the sink that trickled over here, or maybe from a leaky pipe somewhere,” Freel reportedly thought while averting his gaze from the quarter-inch puddle of opaque liquid that stretched from the sinks to the urinal trough. “And I bet it’s only that color because it got mixed with the dirt on the floor. Yeah, that’s…that’s probably it.” At press time, Freel was attempting to convince himself that whatever dripped on his arm when he was exiting the bathroom was clean and perfectly harmless."
"Tour De France Won By Rowdy, Tattooed Biker From Harley Davidson Team","PARIS—In what many are calling the single most dominant performance in the 112-year history of the event, the 2015 Tour de France was won Sunday by Jason “Scab” Vickerson of the Harley Davidson Team.Sources confirmed that the 300-pound, tattoo-covered Scab, who occasionally works as a bouncer at various establishments in Lubbock, TX, handily won the 3,500-kilometer race through the Netherlands, Belgium, and France with a record-breaking 3-hour-and-42-minute margin of victory."
Scientists Warn Planet Cannot Support Growing Gronkowski Population,"ARLINGTON, VA—Noting that they are reproducing at an alarming and unprecedented rate, researchers from the National Science Foundation warned Friday that the planet cannot continue supporting the rapidly growing population of Gronkowskis. “We are quickly approaching the point at which any more Gronkowskis will be utterly disastrous for all life on earth,” said leading researcher Rebecca Davies, adding that large groups of the enormous, powerful, and overly aggressive Gronkowskis have already overrun much of Massachusetts and are now spreading across the United States. “The planet simply doesn’t contain the resources necessary to sustain all these Gronkowskis, especially given the incredible amount of food they consume in a single day. This situation will soon be irreversible, and we as a society have to do something about it before it’s too late.” Davies added that she fully supports new measures to hunt Gronkowskis in rural parts of the country in order to prevent them from encroaching on densely populated cities."
Every Comment On ‘Immaculate Reception’ YouTube Video Clearly From Franco Harris,"PITTSBURGH—Noting that the dozens of rambling, overly excited posts date all the way back to when the clip was first uploaded in early 2011, sources confirmed Thursday that every comment below a YouTube video of the famed 1972 “Immaculate Reception” football play was clearly written by Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris. “Hands down THE best play in NFL history,” read a post left at 3:45 a.m. by YouTube user FHarris32, whose avatar appears to be a recent photo of Harris wearing his four Super Bowl rings on both hands. “This is what started the Steel Curtain dynasty and helped create one of the greatest teams of all-time. I still can’t believe I caught the ball like that after it was knocked down. Go Steelers!!!!” At press time, a long, largely incoherent rant disputing the “bullshit catch” had been posted by a YouTube account suspected to belong to former Oakland Raiders safety Jack Tatum."
"Study: Majority Of Baseball Games Between Twins, A’s","LINCOLN, NE—According to a comprehensive new study published Wednesday by the University of Nebraska, the vast majority of Major League Baseball games are played between the Minnesota Twins and the Oakland Athletics. “Our research has conclusively shown that out of the entirety of professional baseball games held in the United States, over 85 percent are regular-season matchups between the Twins and the A’s,” said lead researcher Alex Morrell, adding that virtually every MLB game over the past 40 years has pitted the A’s against the Twins in Minneapolis. “If you were to, say, choose any game throughout the week at random, there’s an overwhelming probability that you would see A’s pitcher Sonny Gray starting on the mound, with Brian Dozier leading off for the Twins.” Morrell added that of the small remaining percentage of major league games, none whatsoever involve the San Diego Padres."

Authorities Warn Away Fans At Dodger Stadium To Always Wear Team-Neutral Body Armor,"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to prevent violent confrontations between spectators during home games, Los Angeles law enforcement officials released a statement Tuesday warning all away fans at Dodger Stadium to always wear team-neutral body armor. “We strongly advise any visiting fans attending Dodgers games to avoid wearing Kevlar vests and ballistic face masks featuring colors of the away team,” said LAPD chief Charlie Beck, adding that anyone donning aramid helmets with an opposing team’s logo are increasing their chances of a dispute with home fans during or immediately after the game. “The safest option is to simply wear either a plain white or plain black military-grade, hard-plate reinforced bodysuit to ensure that you can safely enjoy the game and then get into your armored vehicle and drive home without any issues.” Beck added that stadium stewards maintain the right to ask any spectators sitting behind home plate to cover up opposing team logos with a Dodgers riot shield."
‘SportsCenter’ Co-Anchors Clearly Dating,"BRISTOL, CT—Saying that the pair could barely take their eyes off one another throughout the hour-long sports news program, ESPN viewers told reporters Friday that it is increasingly clear SportsCenter anchors John Anderson and Matt Barrie are currently dating. “Based on the way they keep smiling at each other, it’s pretty obvious something’s going on there,” said Athens, GA resident Paul Nevins, 37, adding that the hosts were openly flirting with each other throughout the “Top 10 Plays” countdown, with Barrie at one point mentioning how cute Anderson looked in his suit today. “They must have taken a trip to Florida together, because they couldn’t stop bringing up some weekend getaway during a segment on the Marlins. Then when Anderson threw to Barrie before the next story, I swear I heard him say, ‘Thanks, honey.’ I’m pretty sure they’re playing footsie underneath that SportsCenter desk, too.” At press time, Anderson and Barrie could be seen holding hands as the broadcast returned from commercial."
No One Seems To Know Guy Leaning Against Batting Cages Giving Hitting Advice,"MADISON, WI—Saying that he is constantly offering words of encouragement and various pointers on maintaining a proper stance, sources confirmed Tuesday that no one at Damen’s Sports Complex appears to know a middle-aged man leaning against the batting cages giving people hitting advice. “At first, I thought the kid in the cage was his son, but he left a while ago and this guy is still standing there telling people to choke up on the bat and step into the ball more,” said local 24-year-old Anthony Wilson, adding that the stranger has enthusiastically clapped his hands and shouted “There you go, nice cut!” whenever a batter has made good contact with the ball. “Whoever he is, he definitely doesn’t work here, but he doesn’t seem to be waiting in line to bat either. He kept telling me to rotate my hips more when I swing and then explained how so much of hitting is in your legs. At one point, I kind of curtly thanked him hoping he’d give it a rest, but he just kept talking to me throughout my whole turn.” At press time, witnesses confirmed that the unidentified man was growing visibly frustrated by a 14-year-old who had completely missed the ball on every one of his swings."
Stadium’s Pathetic Home Run Animation Doesn’t Even Show Ball Screaming While Leaving Earth,"CLEVELAND—Calling it a complete and utter failure not worthy of Major League Baseball, sources at Progressive Field confirmed Monday that the stadium’s pathetic home run animation doesn’t even show a baseball screaming as it leaves Earth and flies into outer space. “You don’t get to see the ball’s cover fly off while it rockets out of the atmosphere and becomes a distant twinkle in space—are you kidding me?” said spectator Jake Vaughn, 37, adding that the pitiful excuse for a scoreboard graphic simply shows a large, slowly rotating baseball imprinted with the Cleveland Indians logo as the phrase “Home Run!” appears surrounded by exploding fireworks. “First of all, the ball doesn’t even have eyes or a mouth, but it wouldn’t even matter unless it was terrified and screaming next to a speech bubble that says ‘So long!’ or ‘It’s outta here!’ I mean, c’mon, this is supposed to be the fucking big leagues.” Fans noted, however, that the Jumbotron’s only saving grace is its strikeout animation, which does indeed show the ball catching fire and burning a hole through the catcher’s mitt."
Braves Manager Reminds Players He’ll Throw Out All Unclaimed Steroids In Locker Room Fridge On Friday,"ATLANTA—Stressing that the small bit of housecleaning still needs to be addressed, Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez reportedly reminded his players Wednesday that he will be throwing out all unclaimed steroids left in the locker room refrigerator by the end of the day on Friday. “Just wanted to let you guys know that any solution vials, tablet bottles, and topicals that are still left on the fridge shelves will be discarded at the end of the week,” Gonzalez wrote in an email to the team obtained by reporters, adding that if players do not pick up their performance-enhancing drugs by then, he will assume they no longer want them. “Some of these bottles of Winstrol have been sitting in there untouched for weeks, and we’re starting to run out of space. I want to get it all cleaned up before our next road trip so we’re not coming back to a mess. Please label such items or let me know if you still want them.” Gonzalez reportedly concluded the message by stating that he expects whoever spilled testosterone cream all over the refrigerator’s bottom drawer to clean up after themselves."
"Pete Rose, Tim Donaghy Among Class Of 2015 Inductees For Sports Betting Hall Of Fame","ATLANTIC CITY, NJ—Joining such greats as Green Bay Packers running back Paul Hornung and “Shoeless” Joe Jackson of the 1919 Chicago White Sox, former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose and retired NBA referee Tim Donaghy were among the inductees enshrined Monday evening in the Sports Betting Hall of Fame. “It is my incredible honor to recognize the life’s work of the class of 2015, each of whom brought gambling on professional sports to a whole new level,” chairman Phillip DiCarmine said in his opening speech at the Hotel Borgata Casino, adding that the whistle Donaghy used during the 2007 NBA playoffs would be added to the hall’s memorabilia collection, as would Pete Rose’s betting slips from the final few years of his Major League Baseball career. “Although sports betting has seen scores of exceptional oddsmakers, loan sharks, and gambling-addicted athletes, this hall is reserved for the greatest of all time. The men whose busts will now adorn Atlantic City will be forever remembered for how they successfully covered the spread, and for their relentless pursuit of perfection when placing multiple-team parlays.” Reached for comment, Rose acknowledged that his induction into the Hall of Fame marks his proudest moment, and one that he had been working toward his entire life."
Younger Vikings Players Picking Adrian Peterson’s Brain For Parenting Tips,"EDEN PRAIRIE, MN—Hoping to gain some insight from his incredible wealth of knowledge and experience, younger Minnesota Vikings players told reporters Friday that they have been picking running back Adrian Peterson’s brain during minicamp for helpful parenting advice. “My 4-year-old has been throwing a ton of tantrums lately, so naturally I sought out Adrian to see how he handles these situations with his own kids,” said wide receiver Adam Thielen, adding that he hoped to get the six-time Pro Bowler’s perspective on how to quickly and effectively discipline his children to prevent their bad behavior from getting out of hand. “Sometimes when I tell her to clear her plate, she’ll just outright ignore me, and getting her ready for bed is always such a struggle every single night. But Adrian is the go-to guy on the team for all this stuff, so I’m sure he has a few tricks up his sleeve. He’s always willing to take the younger guys on the team aside and talk about fatherhood and the responsibilities of raising a family.” At press time, local police officers were responding to a spate of 911 calls relating to domestic violence throughout the Twin Cities area."
Bubba Watson Horrified To Learn Two-Thirds Of Earth Covered In Water Hazards,"UNIVERSITY PLACE, WA—Utterly overwhelmed by the thought of the planet’s surface containing such an unfathomable amount of the natural course obstacles, pro golfer Bubba Watson expressed both shock and fear Friday upon learning that approximately two-thirds of Earth is covered in water hazards. “It’s actually disturbing to think about water hazards making up over 70 percent of the world,” a wide-eyed Watson told reporters, noting with visible anxiety that the Pacific Ocean alone is over 60 million square miles of water hazard. “Think about it—you can look out from the edge of the rough and see nothing but a huge water hazard for thousands and thousands of miles. And some of the water hazards are so deep that no golf balls have ever even sunk all the way to the bottom. God, it’s just staggering.” Sources later confirmed that Watson was equally stunned after finding out that over 25 percent of the African continent is a single massive sand trap."
Guy Sipping Energy Drink On Subway Probably Heading Off To Snowboard In X Games Or Something,"NEW YORK—Speculating that his life must be one of constant thrills and unbridled adventure, subway sources confirmed Thursday that the guy currently sipping an energy drink while riding the downtown 6 train is probably heading off to snowboard in the X Games or engage in some other mind-blowing extreme sport. “Judging by that can of energy drink in his hand, this guy must be on his way to compete in some kind of freestyle snowpipe event, or maybe carve massive waves in an international surfing championship,” said fellow commuter Josh Harper, noting that the audacious, risk-taking man would surely need the mental and physical stimulation provided by his energy drink in order to, most likely, free climb a 3,000-foot cliff face and then BASE jump back down to the bottom once he reached the top. “It’s obvious that coffee alone isn’t enough for this guy—he needs a serious boost if he’s going to pull off a perfect 1080 on a skateboarding vert ramp or take first place in his winner-take-all motocross race. Honestly, I’m just amazed he’s willing to put up with the drudgery of a subway ride when he could be traversing the whole city through a series of impossibly acrobatic parkour maneuvers.” At press time, sources noted that the energy drink-consuming daredevil had taken an available subway seat, surely in order to conserve his energy for his upcoming kiteboarding excursion."
"Patriots Horrified After New Super Bowl Rings Cause Fingers To Shrivel Up, Turn Black","CHESTNUT HILL, MA—Moments after receiving their Super Bowl XLIX championship rings at team owner Robert Kraft’s home earlier this week, sources confirmed that New England Patriots players and coaches were horrified to find that the rings caused their fingers to instantly shrivel up and turn black. “Oh my God!” a horrified Julian Edelman screamed moments after slipping on the diamond-encrusted band, which immediately turned his ring finger into a shrunken, dried husk of charcoal flesh as spider-like tendrils of black rot rapidly spread up the wide receiver’s arm. “It’s burning me! It’s so hot! Wait, it’s—it’s not coming off! Oh, God, it’s not coming off! Help! Please help me!” At press time, as his players shrieked and clutched at their ashen, mutating arms, head coach Bill Belichick donned all four of his Super Bowl rings and could be observed cackling madly as he began levitating several feet above the ground."
Sexist Pig Has No Idea When Team USA Playing Nigeria,"NORTHFORD, CT—Revealing just how old-fashioned and small-minded he truly is, local sexist pig Jonathan Scott admitted Monday he has no idea what time the U.S. women’s soccer team plays Nigeria tomorrow night, sources reported. “Is the game on at 4 or 8?” said the misogynistic prick, who clearly believes that women are inferior athletes to men and therefore do not deserve an opportunity to participate in major athletic competitions such as the Women’s World Cup. “It’s on Fox, right? Not Fox Sports 1?” The disgusting woman-hater then reportedly questioned whether Team USA’s offense could get its act together in time for the knockout rounds."
NBA Players Association Calls For Increased Referee Presence In High-Foul Areas,"NEW YORK—Noting that the rampant problem has devastated rosters across the league, representatives from the National Basketball Players Association demanded an increased referee presence in high-foul areas, sources confirmed Friday. “Something has to be done to crack down on all the foul-ridden sections of the court, and the only solution is having more referees out there to combat this issue head-on,” said NBPA executive director Michele Roberts, adding that the league must immediately position additional officials in the low post area, which has become a hotspot for personal, technical, and flagrant fouls. “We can’t let this situation get any worse than it already is. We’ve seen too many instances of power forwards and shooting guards getting hacked out there, and there are certain parts of the paint where players are too scared to even drive. It’s absolutely unacceptable.” Roberts added that the NBA needs to implement a zero-tolerance policy toward repeat offenders who are guilty of committing multiple loose-ball fouls in a single game."
Tampa Bay Lightning Maintain Home Advantage By Restricting Admission To Fans Weighing 300 Pounds Or Less,"TAMPA, FL—In an effort to limit the number of opposing Chicago Blackhawks fans attending Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals, officials from the Tampa Bay Lightning announced Friday that Amalie Arena will be restricting admission exclusively to patrons who weigh 300 pounds or less. “With the goal of maintaining a fully supportive crowd and a distinct home-ice advantage for the Lightning, we have decided to prevent the attendance of any individual medically classified as obese,” arena general manager Darryl Benge told reporters, noting that his staff has been explicitly instructed to bar the entrance of men and women wearing hockey jerseys that are size XXXL or larger. “We’re just doing everything we can to create a positive playoff atmosphere that gives our team the best chance to win, which means taking steps to ensure that our players aren’t bombarded with husky, constrained boos in between belabored breaths and gulps of Pepsi.” Benge added that any spectators who visit the concession stands and attempt to purchase more than four orders of nachos will be immediately removed by stadium security."
FIFA Advises Female Players Unhappy With Turf To Spend More Time In Midair,"ZURICH—Following widespread complaints that teams in the Women’s World Cup have been forced to play on synthetic fields, officials from FIFA held a press conference Thursday advising players unhappy with the turf to spend more time in midair. “In light of recent concerns, we are encouraging all players unsatisfied with the current field conditions to remain suspended in the air for as long as possible during matches,” said FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke, adding that players can minimize the higher risk of injury associated with artificial turf by keeping their bodies at least six inches above the rubber-based field during jumping headers or scissor kicks. “Anyone worried about severe bruising or painful skin abrasions should consider continuously leaping throughout all 90 minutes of a game in order to avoid too much direct contact with the playing surface. And while the turf does reach temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the air above it is at least 20 to 30 degrees cooler, which is a perfectly suitable and reasonable alternative.” Valcke then quickly assured reporters that all men’s teams at the 2018 World Cup in Russia will play on perfectly manicured grass fields of the highest quality."
Baseball Fan Attempting To Visit Each MLB Player’s Home In One Season,"SAGINAW, MI—In a journey that will take him thousands of miles across the country, local baseball fan Patrick Lund, 32, revealed to reporters Friday that he is currently attempting to visit the home of every Major League Baseball player in a single season. “Ever since I was a little kid, I had a goal to step foot inside the personal property of each player in the majors, and this year I decided to just go on a road trip to all 750 houses in the same season,” said Lund, adding that after arriving at a player’s private residence, he always eats a hot dog and takes a picture of himself standing next to the front door. “So far, I’ve ticked off Adrian Gonzalez, David Price, Bryce Harper, Jose Altuve, Eric Hosmer, Clayton Kershaw, Matt Carpenter, and Nelson Cruz, but I’m sure I can get to all of them before October rolls around. I’ve always wanted to see the ivy leaves in James Shields’ backyard, so I’m really excited to go there next.” Lund added that while many of the homes he has already visited were incredibly beautiful, the dilapidated one-bedroom apartment of Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher A.J. Burnett was by far the worst."
"Excited, Nervous J.R. Smith Unable To Sleep Through David Blatt’s Pregame Speech","OAKLAND, CA—Saying that he had so much pent-up energy that he would likely remain wide awake until tip-off, Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard J.R. Smith told reporters Thursday that he was far too excited and nervous before Game 1 of the NBA Finals to sleep through head coach David Blatt’s locker room speech. “I can usually doze off around now without any problem, but tonight is such a big game that I’ll probably be up the whole time Coach is speaking,” said Smith, adding that he was the only Cavs player who was still awake while Blatt reiterated the team’s defensive strategy for stopping Stephen Curry. “I’ve tried everything—earplugs, counting backwards from 100, even listening to some ambient music—but I’m still just here with my eyes wide open staring at Coach talking about giving our all to bring a championship to Cleveland. By the time I do finally fall asleep, it’ll probably be game time anyway.” Smith expressed some relief, however, when acknowledging that he will at least be able to catch up on some sleep during Blatt’s halftime team talk."
FIFA Assures Fans Investigation Won’t Affect 2022 Qatar Slush Fund,"ZURICH—Stressing that soccer’s international governing body will continue to conduct business as usual in the face of high-profile fraud charges, FIFA officials assured the public Friday that the ongoing U.S. Department of Justice investigation will in no way affect the 2022 Qatar slush fund. “While our organization takes these allegations very seriously, we can guarantee with total confidence that the charges will not hinder or restrict the 2022 slush fund in Qatar,” said FIFA president Sepp Blatter, adding that the unreported personal expenditures and under-the-table government kickbacks will take place at multiple venues throughout the Middle Eastern country as scheduled. “Regardless of this ongoing probe, our officials are committed to accepting bribes in exchange for FIFA media and marketing rights, redirecting construction funds to personal expense accounts, and offering lavish gifts to Qatari political ministers in order to sidestep government regulations exactly as originally planned. These accusations of wrongdoing will not be a distraction as we prepare for what we all hope will be the greatest FIFA slush fund yet.” Blatter added that the indictments will also have no effect on the 2018 slush fund in Russia, noting that the country’s framework for corruption is already firmly in place."
Report: Underpaid Migrant Laborers Working 18 Hours Per Day On FIFA Legal Defense,"ZURICH—Following a massive U.S. Department of Justice indictment alleging that high-ranking members of the global soccer organization conducted widespread financial fraud, sources confirmed Thursday that underpaid migrant laborers are currently working roughly 18 hours a day preparing FIFA’s legal defense. “We have reason to believe that dozens of malnourished, impoverished workers are being exploited by FIFA for their labor as they attempt to build a defense strategy for charges including bribery, money laundering, and racketeering,” said Human Rights Watch spokesperson Reed Brody, noting that the laborers, who originate from countries including Bangladesh, Thailand, and Senegal, have been reviewing financial records and filing subpoenas for hours on end in a fetid, dimly lit boiler room inside FIFA headquarters. “Some of those working to research relevant RICO cases are said to be as young as 14 years old, and we know of at least three cases of workers who died of exhaustion while preparing documents for pretrial motions. Of course, for all this grueling paralegal work, they are still only making a nominal 32 cents per hour.” Brody added that human rights organizations are also investigating reports of a Nepalese man who disappeared the day after attempting to submit a guilty plea on behalf of an indicted FIFA official."
FIFA Frantically Announces 2015 Summer World Cup In United States,"ZURICH—After the Justice Department indicted numerous executives from world soccer’s governing body on charges of corruption and bribery, frantic and visibly nervous officials from FIFA held an impromptu press conference Wednesday to announce that the United States has been selected to host this summer’s 2015 World Cup. “We are thrilled to reveal that, for the first time in 21 years, the World Cup will finally return to America, with matches set to kick off today at 5 p.m. local time in Los Angeles,” said FIFA president Sepp Blatter, smiling broadly before unveiling the tournament’s official logo, a hand-drawn stick figure kicking a soccer ball with “USA 2015!” hastily scribbled in black marker above its head. “With world-class venues in cities across the country and a rapidly growing passion for the sport, the U.S. is the perfect choice—really the only choice—for this summer’s tournament. Everyone at FIFA is certain that the 2015 World Cup in America will be a tremendous success, and billions of fans from around the world will, in just a few hours, come together to enjoy this wonderful display of soccer over the coming weeks.” At press time, the U.S. national team was leading defending champions Germany in the World Cup’s opening match after being awarded 12 penalties in the game’s first three minutes."
Hockey Fans Treated To Rare Sighting Of Zamboni Giving Birth,"ANAHEIM, CA—With thousands of spectators visibly emotional after witnessing the heartwarming moment, fans at Monday night’s playoff game between the Anaheim Ducks and Chicago Blackhawks were reportedly treated to the rare sight of a pregnant Zamboni giving birth. “When the Zamboni started slowing down and shaking during the intermission, I initially thought something was wrong, but then I realized it was actually in labor,” said Anaheim fan Kyle Boneta, 32, adding that, after crowning for several minutes, the motor oil–covered newborn Zamboni then fell squeegee-first from its exhausted mother’s underside and onto the Ducks logo at center ice. “He eventually got up and tried to move around, but he was wobbling a lot because his wheels were so small. The whole thing was beautiful, especially seeing the little guy follow his mother around as they resurfaced the ice before the third period. It was really adorable.” Ducks officials told reporters the delivery was a far greater success than a similar event during the 2013 playoffs, when a Zamboni quickly devoured its offspring shortly after giving birth."
James Harden Pretty Sure He Felt Something Pop In Lower Beard,"HOUSTON—Expressing concern that the injury could sideline him for the remainder of the postseason, Houston Rockets shooting guard James Harden confirmed Friday that he felt something pop in his lower beard during last night’s game against the Golden State Warriors. “I was going up for a rebound, and all of a sudden I heard this loud snap followed by a sudden rush of excruciating pain in the lower part of my beard,” said Harden, adding that he immediately rushed to the locker room clutching his rapidly swelling facial hair in both hands. “I’ve been icing it, but it doesn’t look like the inflammation is going down much, and it still hurts a lot whenever I try running my fingers through it. We’ll see how it feels for tomorrow’s game, but right now I’m just hoping that I don’t need offseason beard surgery.” At press time, Harden was meeting with Rockets medical personnel in order to discuss receiving a cortisone injection directly into his beard that would enable him to play through the pain."
Bored David Blatt Just Drawing Up Plays For Fun During Cavs Game,"ATLANTA—Explaining it was merely something to occupy his attention throughout the evening, Cleveland Cavaliers head coach David Blatt revealed to reporters that he was spending the majority of Wednesday night’s Eastern Conference Finals game against the Atlanta Hawks drawing up plays for fun on the sideline. “I figured I have nothing else to do, so I might as well try to think up some weird plays while I’m sitting here,” Blatt said while sketching out an increasingly elaborate offensive sequence involving 12 consecutive pick-and-rolls before the point guard shoots the ball from the baseline. “I know none of these plays will ever get used, so I’m just seeing what I can come up with. I drew this one with five centers all stacked together on the perimeter, and then they rush to the basket at the same time and pass the ball behind their backs until the last guy dunks it—that one was really cool.” At press time, after calling a timeout in the third quarter, Cavs forward LeBron James grabbed Blatt’s clipboard out of his hands, quickly erased it, and began diagramming the team’s next inbounds play."
Report: Most Arena Football Games End With Players Just Kind Of Walking Off Field,"LOUISVILLE, KY—According to a study published Friday by the University of Louisville, the majority of Arena Football League games abruptly end with the players just kind of walking off the field. “We found that arena football games frequently end in the middle of a play as the player with the ball suddenly slows to a stop, tosses the ball onto the turf, and heads to the sideline with his teammates and opposing players,” said report lead author Richard Perelman, adding that, despite no whistle or buzzer of any kind sounding in the stadium, most AFL players begin gradually exiting the field of play in the middle of the third quarter while the game clock is still running. “The winner generally ends up being whichever team has more points when the last player steps off the field. Occasionally a couple players, coaches, or referees will stick around and casually throw the ball around, but the stadium’s lights will usually turn off a few minutes into the fourth quarter and then they’ll go home as well.” Perelman went on to confirm that most ArenaBowl championship games never end up taking place, as no players, coaches, or fans show up at all."
Nation Braces Itself Before Clicking On Article About 55-Year-Old Ex-NFL Player,"WASHINGTON—Taking a brief moment to mentally prepare for any number of potentially disturbing or utterly heartbreaking stories, millions of Americans reportedly steeled themselves Wednesday before clicking on a news article about a 55-year-old former NFL player. “As soon as I saw the words ‘Ex-NFL Player’ in the headline, I just thought, ‘Well, this is going to ruin my day,’” said Rockville, MD resident Alex Thorne, echoing fans across the nation who speculated that the story would likely involve some horrific combination of bankruptcy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, drug addiction, murder, or suicide. “Honestly, I shouldn’t even read it, but I know I will, and I also know I’ll feel absolutely awful after I do. Might as well just get it over with.” At press time, the entire U.S. populace had decided en masse to simply avoid reading a breaking story about a current college football star."
Bears GM Confident Team Has Right Pieces In Place To Trade Jay Cutler,"CHICAGO—Claiming that the franchise is now on the brink of finally achieving something truly great, Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Pace expressed his confidence Tuesday that the team has the right pieces in place to trade quarterback Jay Cutler. “We’ve been working toward this for a long time, and we’re finally in a position to make our shared goal of getting Jay out of Chicago a reality,” said Pace, noting that the recent addition of several highly rated draft picks gives the Bears the necessary firepower to convince another team to take on Cutler’s contract. “It’s going to take a lot of hard work and a bit of luck, but I believe we will accomplish what our players and coaching staff have dreamed about these last few years. There are plenty of doubters who think it will never happen, but I can tell you that everyone within the organization is aiming to prove them wrong. Next season, it’s trade Cutler or bust.” Reached for comment, Cutler expressed his willingness to do whatever it takes to help his team by getting the fuck out of Chicago next year."
Buccaneers In-House Counsel Already Has 26 Missed Calls From Jameis Winston,"TAMPA, FL—Noting that his phone’s voicemail has been almost single-handedly filled by the rookie quarterback, Tampa Bay Buccaneers general counsel David Cohen confirmed Friday that he has already received 26 missed calls from Jameis Winston. “As of this morning, he’s called me more than two dozen times, mostly between the hours of 1 and 4 a.m.,” said Cohen, adding that, of the 14 voicemails Winston chose to leave for him, the majority are frantic, incoherent messages partially drowned out by the sound of shouting in the background. “He usually ends them by asking me to call him back as soon as possible. One of the recordings was just him screaming that he didn’t do anything, but that we needed to send [Director of Team Security] Andres [Trescastro] to a Tampa Bay–area bowling alley right away.” Cohen added that, other than the voicemails, no one in the organization has seen or heard from Winston since the NFL Draft."
Tom Brady Keeps Referring To Self As ‘Golden Boy’ While Denying Cheating Allegations,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—Following the release of an independent investigation implicating him in the New England Patriots’ ball-deflation scandal, quarterback Tom Brady held a press conference Thursday during which he staunchly denied all allegations while repeatedly referring to himself as the “Golden Boy.” “The Golden Boy would like to state right now, for the record, that at no time did the Golden Boy have any knowledge that team assistants were tampering with game balls,” said Brady, adding that, given the paramount importance of maintaining the game’s integrity, the Golden Boy would never, under any circumstances, seek an unfair advantage in order to win. “This investigation is obviously deeply flawed, and the Golden Boy looks forward to speaking to Commissioner Goodell so the Golden Boy can clear the Golden Boy’s name and focus on next season.” Brady reportedly ended the press conference by telling reporters that the Golden Boy will not be taking any questions and then promptly walked out of the room."
"Tiger Woods, Lindsey Vonn Blame Breakup On Hectic Sex Lives","JUPITER ISLAND, FL—Explaining that the pressures of their day-to-day commitments had given them no other choice but to end their three-year relationship, golf star Tiger Woods and Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn released a joint statement Wednesday blaming their breakup on their hectic sex lives. “We’ll always share mutual admiration and respect for one another, but the reality is that our individual schedules have us fucking people in different cities around the world over 40 weeks out of the year,” the statement read, which went on to say that Woods and Vonn are each so busy running around riding rock-hard cock and deep-dicking tight, dripping-wet pussy that it is virtually impossible to devote adequate attention to their relationship. “We’ll have a couple days alone here or there, but then Lindsey will head to the airport for a three-day gang bang at a Switzerland ski resort, or Tiger will line up a few amateur fetish models in Miami and be gone for two weeks. By the time we get a few moments to ourselves, we barely have the energy to get on the sex swing together and fuck all night.” The pair added that they will always cherish the memories they made while double-fisting each other in front of a group of their closest friends."
Report: Philippines Citizens Currently Watching Their Congressman Fight A Guy On TV,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES—As boxing fans around the world turn their attention to one of the most eagerly anticipated bouts in years, reports confirmed Saturday evening that citizens of the Philippines are currently watching one of their congressmen fight a man on television.According to sources throughout the Southeast Asian island nation, roughly the entire Filipino populace has gathered around their television sets in order to witness a member of the Philippine House of Representatives engage in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Reports indicated that the legislator, who has dutifully served the people of the Sarangani province for the past five years, is presently being cheered on by his constituents as he attempts to knock out another man during a live pay-per-view broadcast."
Draft Pick Hugs Family That Will Bleed Him Dry Over Next 5 Years,"CHICAGO—Upon hearing his name announced by commissioner Roger Goodell during the first round of the NFL draft Thursday, wide receiver Anthony Parker immediately began embracing the family members who will slowly bleed him dry over the next five years, sources confirmed. According to witnesses, Parker spent several seconds in the arms of his teary-eyed mother, a woman now expecting a brand-new luxury car to be sitting in her driveway within the next three months, before then moving on to hug his three brothers, all of whom intend to live with their friends in his soon-to-be-purchased mansion for free. Sources also revealed that Parker received a slew of text messages from various cousins and uncles—the future recipients of sizable loans they will never pay back—while he gave a special handshake to a close childhood friend who will drag him to strip clubs multiple times a week for the duration of his playing career to blow half of his paycheck. At press time, Parker’s night had reportedly culminated in his son’s conception, which will cost him roughly $65,000 per year in child support payments and ultimately drive him into bankruptcy in March 2021."
Raiders Considering Taking Chance On Prospect With Zero Off-Field Incidents,"CHICAGO—Noting that it would be a swift departure from the organization’s past draft strategy, sources within the Oakland Raiders front office confirmed Thursday that the team is considering taking a chance on an NFL prospect with no off-field incidents. “The Raiders are indeed looking at selecting a young wide receiver despite being fully aware of the zero red flags regarding his character and attitude,” said ESPN analyst Adam Schefter, adding that, given the player’s clean criminal record and unblemished public reputation, Raiders coaches and scouts invited him to numerous face-to-face meetings this week in order to determine whether he would ultimately be a good fit for the team. “There are actually a few guys in this year’s draft who are undeniably talented and would address Oakland’s needs, but have no prior history of arrests or off-field issues, so it will be interesting to see whether the Raiders end up gambling on them or not.” At press time, the Raiders have reportedly opted to hedge their bets and wait to see if the player is still available in the draft’s later rounds."
Mel Kiper Seeks Blind Oracle’s Prophecy Of Browns’ First-Round Pick,"HINDU KUSH MOUNTAINS—Venturing thousands of miles to reach the remote mountain village where the ancient soothsayer was rumored to be found, ESPN analyst Mel Kiper sought out the sage counsel of blind oracle Jayashri in hopes of determining the Cleveland Browns’ first-round pick in the NFL draft, sources confirmed Thursday. “Will Mike Pettine target his team’s needs on the offensive line and seek a highly ranked edge blocker, or will he risk his first pick on a promising wideout in an effort to build a more pass-heavy offense?” Kiper reportedly inquired while kneeling before the white-eyed, 107-year-old “Seer of the Light,” who was adorned with a necklace of desiccated bones and warmed her open palm over a fire of white flames. “Or, as others have prophesied, will Cleveland abandon Johnny Manziel and trade its first-round picks for a chance at gaining Marcus Mariota at quarterback? Please, Mother Jayashri, grant me your invaluable wisdom before the live broadcast of Draft Countdown on ESPN.” At press time, a desperate Kiper could be overheard offering the blood of his first-born child in order to learn how many wide receivers would go in the first round."
Jameis Winston Wows Teams With Ability To Tell Them Exactly What They Want To Hear,"CHICAGO—With prospective players undergoing a final round of interviews and visits ahead of this week’s NFL Draft, sources revealed Wednesday that teams have been totally blown away by the ability of Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston to tell them exactly what they want to hear. “All of the GMs and coaches who talked to him were incredibly impressed after seeing Jameis so skillfully deliver the precise pandering answers they’d hoped for about maturing as a person and focusing solely on football,” said ESPN draft analyst Todd McShay, adding that the 21-year-old was “calm, composed, and totally in his element” while detailing his commitment to staying out of trouble and being a responsible team member. “He’s just such a natural at hitting every one of the generic, meaningless lines of rhetoric about personal growth, putting his past indiscretions behind him, and working hard to become the best quarterback in the league. It’s precisely what coaches were looking for.” McShay added that while Winston is still very young, there is widespread optimism around the league that he will easily transition to playing down his glaring character issues in the pros."
Little League Pitcher Just Getting Fucking Shelled,"RED BANK, NJ—After watching the 11-year-old give up the fourth straight double that inning, sources confirmed Sunday afternoon that local Little League pitcher Dustin Bauer is getting absolutely fucking shelled out there. “Jesus Christ, are they going to yank this kid or just let them keep teeing off on him?” said spectator Chris Wheeler, who added that even the smallest batters on the opposing team have gone yard on the helpless fifth-grader. “I mean, he can barely lob his pitches over home plate. Poor little bastard. I feel bad that his parents have to sit through this.” At press time, an opposing baserunner had successfully stolen second after the catcher sent the ball sailing into center field for the fifth consecutive time."
Left Fielder Thinking About The Ways A Triple Play Could End With Him,"SAN DIEGO—Racking his brain for every conceivable sequence of events that could potentially happen on a baseball field, team sources confirmed that San Diego Padres left fielder Justin Upton spent most of Wednesday night’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks envisioning various scenarios in which a triple play ends with him. “If the bases are loaded and the ball is hit to the third baseman, he could catch it and tag the runner on the way to home plate, and then the runner at second might try to take third, so I could come infield and be in position to tag him out,” said Upton, who reportedly began visualizing theoretical 5-4-7, 4-3-7, and 6-2-4-1-7 triple plays any time two Diamondbacks players got on base with no outs. “Runners on first and second would open up another whole set of possibilities. The second baseman could field a short hopper, step on the bag, and then throw to first, but the throw might go over the first baseman’s head, and if that happens, the runner at second could take off, and—well, the third baseman would have to go down hurt at some point in the middle of the play, so in that case, I’d cover for him and catch the throw from first base to get the last out. Something like that could happen, I guess.” At press time, an excited Upton was in the team’s clubhouse diagramming an unassisted triple play made from left field."
Phillies Concession Stand Offering Plastic Helmets For Fans To Vomit In,"PHILADELPHIA—Calling it a fun new way to enhance the game-day experience, the Philadelphia Phillies announced Thursday that concession stands at Citizens Bank Park will now sell plastic helmets for fans to vomit in. “We’re excited to let all Phillies fans know that, for just $12, they can throw up into an officially licensed novelty helmet modeled after the ones worn by their favorite players,” said team spokesperson Bonnie Clark, adding that the flattened crown of the 8-ounce plastic cap allows intoxicated fans to conveniently rest the helmet between their knees without spilling any vomit onto their lap. “They are dishwasher-safe, so you can always take them home, wash them out, and end up with a great souvenir from the ballgame. Of course, we also offer full-size plastic lids for those who find that the traditional miniature versions are simply not big enough for them, or for those who would rather buy a larger helmet to share with friends.” Clark added that the stadium has already corrected the shortage issues from Monday night’s game, when drunk fans were disappointed to find they could only buy styrofoam bowls to puke in after vendors ran out of the helmets during the fourth inning."
"Gym Teacher Devises Elaborate Sport From Handful Of Foam Cubes, Scooters, Plastic Mats","MIDDLETON, WI—Spending the first 15 minutes of class providing an overview of the game’s litany of complicated rules, local ninth-grade gym teacher Marcus Hartwell invented an elaborate sport Friday using just foam cubes, scooters, and plastic mats, sources confirmed. “All right, guys, so to score in Jammer Ball, you need to shoot the foam blocks at the other team’s mat,” said Hartwell, adding that teams receive one point for cubes landing on either the left or right sections of the large blue folding mat, and three points if a cube lands in the middle. “If you fall off your scooter, then you’re out, unless your goalie catches a cube thrown by the other team and tags you back in. And if you shoot a cube into the basketball hoop, you automatically win. Okay, let’s count off by fours and make teams.” At press time, after students had expressed some initial indifference and confusion, the game had reportedly gotten so intense that Hartwell had to separate two ninth-graders on the verge of fighting after pushing one another off their scooters."
Derrick Rose Pulls Off Perfect 720 At Local Skate Park,"CHICAGO—Following his numerous failed attempts at the challenging skateboard trick, sources confirmed Wednesday that Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose successfully landed a perfect 720-degree aerial at a local skate park.Rose reportedly managed to spin two full rotations after launching off of the tallest vert ramp at Chicago’s Wilson Park, with eyewitnesses confirming that the three-time NBA All-Star reached over 10 feet of air while performing the trick.“That was awesome,” an out-of-breath but visibly excited Rose told reporters. “I’ve been trying to do a 720 for months—I must have tried at least a hundred times—but it was all worth it for that one moment. The hardest part is building enough speed so you can get high enough for that last half-turn. I can’t believe I actually did it.”"
Report: Holding Trophy Above Head Still Number One Celebration Technique,"CINCINNATI—Following an exhaustive 18-month study examining all major American and international sports, a new report published Tuesday by Xavier University’s Department of Sport Studies revealed that holding a trophy high above one’s head remains the number one technique for celebrating a championship. “The data is conclusive in showing that raising a trophy with one or both arms fully extended up into the air is still by far the preferred method for capping off a title win,” said lead researcher Michelle Howe, adding that in such cases, 58 percent of athletes firmly grip the trophy with one hand while raising their other hand in a triumphant fist pump, 72 percent briefly bring the trophy back down to face level in order to kiss it before lifting it above their head again, and a further 34 percent opt for the more unorthodox approach of lifting the trophy together with a coach or teammate. “Hugging a trophy to your chest, holding up one index finger, and shouting ‘Number one, baby!’ into a nearby camera has become increasingly popular recently, but it is still a distant second."" The report went on to confirm that lifting a trophy above one’s head continues to be predominantly followed by striding into a locker room, spraying teammates with champagne, and eventually heading to the nearest strip club."
Stephen Strasburg Encourages Pitchers To Shorten Games By Increasing Speed Of Fastball,"WASHINGTON—With Major League Baseball at risk of losing fans due to the sport’s increasingly slow and lethargic pace, Washington Nationals right-hander Stephen Strasburg reportedly urged pitchers across the league Monday to shorten games by increasing the speed of their fastballs. “No one wants to sit there for three hours to watch one baseball game, so by just upping the velocity of fastballs from, say, 94 miles per hour to 95 miles per hour, we can really quicken the game’s tempo,” said Strasburg, explaining that each slightly accelerated fastball would take roughly 18 fewer milliseconds to reach the plate, which “really adds up” given 300-plus pitches over nine innings. “With this simple change, we can reduce the average length of a game from three hours, four minutes, and 17 seconds to as low as three hours, four minutes, and 11 seconds. It’ll make the experience far more exciting for fans, and frankly, I’m surprised we haven’t done this sooner.” In a further effort to speed up the game, Strasburg suggested that MLB commissioner Rob Manfred restrict all hitting to bunts and line-drive singles."
Cubs Insist Wrigley Field Beef Machine Will Be Ready For Opening Day,"CHICAGO—Responding to growing concerns about the state of offseason renovations to Wrigley Field, officials from the Chicago Cubs assured fans Friday that the stadium’s beef machine will be ready for the team’s opening game. “Cubs baseball has been synonymous with delicious beef for over 100 years, and I can guarantee that the ballpark’s beef machine will be fully functional in time for the first pitch,” team spokesman Julian Green told reporters, adding that construction teams have been working around the clock on the historic 19-foot-tall steel meat grinder in the main concourse, which had not been renovated for decades. “The Wrigley beef machine will be bigger, better, and capable of churning out thousands of pounds of flavorful corned beef, roast beef, brisket, pastrami, and just plain old piles of ground beef. Believe me, everyone in the organization understands how important this is for Cubs fans, and we’ve done everything we can to ensure that they will be happy.” Green also sternly refuted rumors that the Cubs will be forced to play their first several games at U.S. Cellular Field, home of the White Sox, in order to utilize the stadium’s meat broiler."
Wes Welker Fielding Offers From Numerous Concussion Researchers,"DENVER—Saying that it’s a decision he needs to carefully consider and ultimately make together with his family, free agent wide receiver Wes Welker confirmed Thursday that he is currently fielding promising offers from a number of concussion researchers. “I’ve been in contact with quite a few research teams that have shown a lot of interest in bringing me in,” said Welker, adding that he had already held private face-to-face meetings with various medical staffs and toured the facilities at several of the country’s top brain trauma centers. “Ideally, I’d like to head back to New England—that’s where I’m most comfortable, and I’m already very familiar with the concussion doctors there. Some of these research programs are really insistent, though, and are more or less begging that I come to them as soon as possible. It’s all very flattering, but at the end of the day, I want to be surrounded by the absolute best, most talented group of specialists possible.” At press time, Welker had reportedly turned down an offer to return to Denver, where he would have most likely had to share time on the examination table with Broncos wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders."
Aaron Hernandez’s Fiancée: ‘I Have No Idea What Incriminating Evidence Was In The Box I Threw Out’,"FALL RIVER, MA—While testifying during the murder trial of fiancé and former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, Shayanna Jenkins told prosecutors Monday that she had absolutely no idea what incriminating evidence was in the box he asked her to throw out. “I didn’t look inside, so I have no way of knowing if there was a gun in there, or a pile of bloody towels,” said Jenkins, adding that the box weighed roughly 40 pounds and therefore, for all she knew, could also have contained some shell casings removed from the scene of the crime. “Something in there rattled around a bit, but it might have just been a roll of duct tape or a knife with his fingerprints on it. All I know is that it definitely wasn’t the shoes Aaron wore that night, because I got rid of those a couple of hours before that.” When asked to be more specific with her answers, a visibly emotional Jenkins told the prosecution that it was difficult for her to recall the exact events defense attorneys told her happened that night."
Kentucky Cancels Practice For NBA Draft Suit Fitting,"CLEVELAND—Following the Wildcats’ 78-39 victory over West Virginia in the Sweet 16, Kentucky sources confirmed that coach John Calipari had canceled Friday’s practice so the players could get fitted for NBA draft suits. “Coach told us it was really important to be prepared, because draft night is just around the corner and we all need to get measured for suits,” said freshman center Karl-Anthony Towns, adding that Calipari had insisted that it was far more convenient for the tailor to see Kentucky’s starting five at the same appointment. “It’ll be June before we know it, and coach reminded everybody that a bunch of offensive and defensive drills won’t do anything to help us look our best when we’re on the stage representing our new NBA teams.” At press time, Calipari encouraged Kentucky players to leave their schedules open early next week in order to start meeting with agents to discuss potential endorsement deals."
"Nude, Ash-Streaked Dick Vitale Proclaims This What March Madness All About","CLEVELAND—Shrieking at the top of his lungs as he scuttled through Quicken Loans Arena during a game between Wichita State and Notre Dame, sources confirmed Thursday that a fully nude, ash-streaked Dick Vitale was observed loudly proclaiming that this is what March Madness is all about. “Sweet 16, perimeter J’s, diaper dandies—that’s what we came here to see, baby!” a seemingly dissociative Vitale screamed, barging over several spectators as he stumbled down the arena steps and grabbed a CBS camera to directly address viewers. “Slam, bam, jams! Dishing up the rock! Cleaning the glass! Blood! Blood! Blood! Blood! Blood! Blood! It’s March Madness, baby!” At press time, officials were forced to temporarily halt play as an increasingly belligerent Vitale wrestled the ball away from Notre Dame guard Jerian Grant, shouted that he was “going all the way to Indy,” and then sprinted out of the arena."
Dallas Cowboys Honored For Helping Reintegrate Criminals Back Into NFL,"DALLAS—Praising the organization for their refusal to turn their backs on those with a troubled past, the ACLU honored the Dallas Cowboys Wednesday for their ongoing efforts to reintegrate criminals back into the NFL. “We would like to recognize the Dallas Cowboys for their long history of providing an avenue to ex-convicts who are simply seeking a second chance at life as a professional football player,” said ACLU spokesman Carl Holmes, adding that, for over three decades, the team has helped those facing the stigma and legal constraints of a recent felony conviction find paying work as linebackers, offensive linemen, and wide receivers. “Too often, these men have been abandoned by society and left with nowhere to turn, but Jerry Jones and his organization have shown they are willing to take the lead and be that beacon of hope for them. The Cowboys have never been afraid to help those with a criminal history move on from their past mistakes and get back onto the field, and that is truly something special.” Holmes added that, without a group like the Cowboys, it is likely that many of the convicted felons would tragically end up either back in prison, dead, or on the Oakland Raiders."
Fewer NBA Players Choosing To Learn Unborn Child’s Position,"LOS ANGELES—Highlighting a new trend that has grown increasingly prevalent across the league, a new survey released Thursday by the University of Southern California revealed that fewer NBA players are opting to learn their unborn baby’s position. “Many players and their spouses have decided that they would rather wait until after the delivery to discover whether their child is a point guard, a small forward, or even a traditional center who dominates in the post,” said Los Angeles-based obstetrician Dr. Charles Peyrovian, adding that several of his patients have asked him to write their baby’s position on a piece of paper and put it in an envelope in case they change their minds before the birth. “The biggest benefit of waiting is that it prevents parents from developing too many preconceived notions about whether their child will be a perimeter shooter or more of a commanding presence inside the paint. The mystery and anticipation also makes the whole process a little more fun, and it’s really wonderful to see their faces light up when you tell them they just had a little two-guard.” Peyrovian added that while nearly all players have some preference for their child’s position, they’re mainly concerned with making sure their baby is born healthy and with a reliable midrange jumper."
Rick Pitino Likes What He’s Seeing From Freshman Louisville Cheerleader,"SEATTLE—Praising her incredible physique and wide array of intangible qualities, Louisville men’s basketball coach Rick Pitino told reporters Friday that he has absolutely loved what he’s seen thus far from freshman cheerleader Danielle Crawley. “Right now she’s a little raw, but give her time to develop and I think she’ll really turn some heads,” said Pitino, adding that the 19-year-old is already starting to remind him of some of the all-time greats he’s had the pleasure of watching come through the Louisville cheerleading program for more than a decade. “Assuming Danielle sticks around for all four years, we might have something truly special on our hands. She’s young, but when I think of all she could be capable of—well, it’s hard not to get excited just thinking about it.” Pitino added that Crawley is certainly living up to the potential he saw during the handful of her high school games he attended last year."
NFL Launches New Campaign Warning Players About Long-Term Risks Of Retirement,"NEW YORK—Saying that many players assume they are somehow immune to the problems afflicting those who quit football, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced a broad new campaign Wednesday to warn all players about the long-term risks of retirement. “With this initiative, we’re hoping to educate players about the enormous toll they might pay by leaving the game,” said Goodell, adding that the league will highlight the full and potentially debilitating consequences of retirement, which include the frequent and often permanent loss of endorsements that have recently affected a number of high-profile former players. “Sadly, most NFL players will find that, without football, they’ll have completely fallen apart financially by the time they’re in their 40s, and sometimes even earlier than that. We’ve also seen that over time, their public profile begins to wear down, and it’s truly heartbreaking to see them become totally unrecognizable to the fans who once loved and knew them so well.” Goodell added that he aims to extend the awareness campaign to the youth level, as studies have found notions of quitting football have occurred in players as young as 8."
Pete Rose Reinstatement Request Offers MLB Commissioner Lower Vig On Upcoming Emanuel Lopez-Carlos Padilla Fight,"NEW YORK—As part of a formal appeal to lift his lifetime ban from baseball, sources confirmed Wednesday that former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose offered new MLB commissioner Rob Manfred a lower vig on an upcoming boxing match between Emanuel Lopez and Carlos Padilla. “I deeply apologize for tarnishing the integrity of Major League Baseball, but if I am reinstated, I will never disrespect the game of baseball again, and I can also get you some sweet action on this Saturday’s Lopez-Padilla fight, if you’re interested,” read an excerpt of the petition, which went on to say that Rose could get Manfred in on the ground floor with “a good friend” taking bets on the upcoming WBA Super Featherweight World Championship bout. “Look, this is an offer I wouldn’t extend to just anybody, but if you can get me ten large by Friday, I can pull some strings to lower the juice, plus cut your wager in before the opening line. And Lopez is a sure thing—just trust me on that.” Rose added that, if reinstated, he hopes to someday be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in order to “cash in big” on a few longstanding wagers."
NFLPA Received Numerous Complaints From Free Agents Harassed By Cleveland Browns,"WASHINGTON—Expressing their growing concern after being inundated with grievances throughout the past week, officials from the NFL Players Association confirmed Monday that they have received multiple complaints from free agents being harassed by the Cleveland Browns front office. “We’ve unfortunately heard from a host of free agents around the league who have been forced to deal with continuous unwanted and, frankly, pretty aggressive overtures from Browns front office executives and coaches,” said NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith, adding that allegations against the Browns organization include calling potential free agent signings at all times of night, leaving long, rambling messages on their voicemails, and mailing them numerous Browns jerseys already stitched with their name and number. “Several players have independently complained that Browns officials are constantly sending them text messages offering to fly them out to Cleveland and treat them to expensive dinners and a few nights on the town. They evidently just won’t take no for an answer.” At press time, Smith had received a phone call from a distressed free agent claiming that Browns general manager Ray Farmer has been standing on his doorstep holding a contract offer for the past four hours and has refused to leave."
Peter King Realizes Fight With Wife Really About Disappointment In Raiders’ Offseason Moves,"MONTCLAIR, NJ—Midway through an impassioned argument with his wife Friday morning, Sports Illustrated writer Peter King reportedly came to the realization that the fight was actually about his disappointment in the Oakland Raiders’ lackluster roster moves this offseason. “Honey, I didn’t mean to snap at you like that—it’s just that I’m so frustrated that the Raiders front office isn’t willing to make the additions needed to put Oakland back into contention in the AFC West,” said the veteran columnist, adding that their altercation over whose turn it was to unload the dishwasher was just his way of conveying his resentment that the Raiders had signed a series of stopgap defensive players without making any effort to find a long-term solution to improve their pass rush. “I’m not angry at you, Ann. I’m angry at Mark Davis and the Raiders coaching staff for refusing to acknowledge that players like Lee Smith and Nate Allen just aren’t going to get this franchise any closer to snapping its 12-year playoff drought. Look, this free agency period has just been really stressful for me, and I’m sorry for taking that out on you. I love you—you know I love you.” King went on to assure his wife that he will never lose his temper the way he did during a particularly ugly incident in 1997, when several concerned neighbors reportedly called the police on the night the Bears announced they were trading a first-round draft pick to the Seahawks in exchange for quarterback Rick Mirer."
Fantasy Baseball Commissioner Plumbs Deepest Depths Of Friend Circle To Find 12th Participant,"NEW YORK—With NFL free agency now in full swing, league sources confirmed Wednesday that a whirlwind past 24 hours has resulted in every single player from every team being traded, announcing his retirement, signing with a new team, getting cut, and then re-signing with a different team. “The dust is obviously still settling, but the balance of power has undoubtedly shifted in all eight divisions across the league as over 1,500 players have now agreed to contracts with their new organizations,” said ESPN analyst Adam Schefter, explaining that players each switched teams an average of 57 times yesterday while being traded, cut, and then retiring from the NFL, before then coming out of retirement to be signed, cut, re-signed, cut again, re-signed again, and then traded continuously every 30 minutes or so for the subsequent 18 hours. “It’ll be interesting to see how Calvin Johnson does next season after being cut by the Lions, signing with the Browns, getting traded to Houston, getting traded again to Minnesota, announcing his retirement, signing with the Eagles two hours later, getting cut an hour after that, signing with the Jets, and then getting traded back to the Lions in exchange for Brandon Pettigrew and a third-round draft pick. Of course, this will also depend on whether the Jets end up keeping Pettigrew or, as it’s being rumored, ship him to the Packers for Russell Wilson in a 19-team trade that would take Andrew Luck to the Cowboys, send Antonio Brown and Justin Tuck to the Chiefs, and bring J.J. Watt back to the Saints, where he was just released about five minutes ago.” At press time, sources confirmed that final terms on 14,367 new trades around the NFL are currently being finalized."
"Every Single NFL Player Traded, Retired, Signed, Cut, Re-Signed Over Past 24 Hours","NEW YORK—With NFL free agency now in full swing, league sources confirmed Wednesday that a whirlwind past 24 hours has resulted in every single player from every team being traded, announcing his retirement, signing with a new team, getting cut, and then re-signing with a different team. “The dust is obviously still settling, but the balance of power has undoubtedly shifted in all eight divisions across the league as over 1,500 players have now agreed to contracts with their new organizations,” said ESPN analyst Adam Schefter, explaining that players each switched teams an average of 57 times yesterday while being traded, cut, and then retiring from the NFL, before then coming out of retirement to be signed, cut, re-signed, cut again, re-signed again, and then traded continuously every 30 minutes or so for the subsequent 18 hours. “It’ll be interesting to see how Calvin Johnson does next season after being cut by the Lions, signing with the Browns, getting traded to Houston, getting traded again to Minnesota, announcing his retirement, signing with the Eagles two hours later, getting cut an hour after that, signing with the Jets, and then getting traded back to the Lions in exchange for Brandon Pettigrew and a third-round draft pick.

Producers Carefully Monitoring Buster Olney’s Question Count During Interview,"TAMPA, FL—Keeping a close eye on the analyst during a taping of Baseball Tonight, sources confirmed Friday that ESPN producers have been carefully monitoring Buster Olney’s question count to ensure that the veteran MLB columnist avoids overexerting himself before the season. “It’s only spring training and we want to bring him along slowly, so we’re placing a firm limit on the number of questions he can ask after every game,” said ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, adding that the network’s program for gradually increasing Olney’s question cap is designed to keep him fresh for the grueling seven-month season ahead. “We’ve been working with Buster to get him to adjust his inquiring mechanics so he can be more fluid and natural out there. So far, though, he keeps blowing through his questions and exhausting his count right away, and we end up having to pull him pretty quickly.” At press time, increasing concerns about Olney’s ability to conduct interviews in back-to-back nightly broadcasts were leading producers to consider shutting him down until after the All-Star break."
Report: Cavaliers Players Having Issues Gelling During Postgame Celebrations,"CLEVELAND—Saying that they still appear disjointed and unsure of themselves, sources within the Cleveland Cavaliers organization revealed Thursday that players are having significant issues gelling during postgame celebrations. “Right now the effort and intensity are definitely there, but we’re having a hard time getting everybody on the court in sync after a 30-point blowout,” said an anonymous team source, noting that although individual performances have often been stellar, the group lacks the rhythm and fluidity of a team that knows everyone’s exact role while giving high-fives and congratulating one another on another commanding win. “LeBron recognizes that he has to occasionally just take control of the situation and give a light-hearted postgame interview praising his team’s dominance over the opposition. At the same time, Kevin Love still has a long way to go to adapt to this team’s celebration style, and role players need to come off the bench and do more to cheer for their teammates after the final buzzer. I would say it’s definitely a work in progress.” Locker room sources expressed confidence, however, that the team has enough time to develop the chemistry needed to eventually put together a great NBA championship parade by June."
Bulls Executives Sickened By Replays Of Derrick Rose Getting Drafted,"CHICAGO—Calling the video “stomach-turning” and “deeply upsetting,” members of the Chicago Bulls front office were visibly sickened Wednesday after seeing replays of Derrick Rose getting drafted. “It’s hard to watch—you never want to see something like that happen,” said Chicago general manager Gar Forman, grimacing in clear discomfort as he viewed various angles of Rose walking onto the 2008 NBA Draft stage, putting on a Chicago Bulls hat, and shaking hands with David Stern. “I’ve seen it a few times now, and it still makes me cringe. I suppose it’s all part of the game, but God, it’s just awful.” Forman later told reporters that he at least takes some solace in knowing that the situation could have been far worse, pointing to the utterly disturbing footage of Michael Beasley being selected as the second overall pick."
ESPN Coverage Displays Clear Bias Toward Shitty Reporting,"FAIRFAX, VA—Following a comprehensive 18-month study of programming trends and journalistic practices at the network, a report published Monday by the Center for Media and Public Affairs revealed that the majority of ESPN’s news coverage demonstrates an obvious bias toward shitty reporting. “Our researchers quickly identified a distinct and unmistakable tendency in ESPN’s presentation of stories clearly favoring overly simplistic, totally sensationalized garbage that barely passes as journalism,” said the report’s lead author, Megan Riordan, adding that the media organization’s bias is particularly blatant during its coverage of significant breaking news events. “Indeed, it appears that ESPN has a calculated agenda to promote the most mind-numbingly repetitive and obnoxiously self-indulgent reporting imaginable, meanwhile devoting very little time to well-thought-out, carefully written stories about issues of actual substance in the sports world. There’s a glaring conflict of interest here, and it’s crucial for viewers to be aware of it.” Reached for comment, ESPN officials refused to respond to any allegations of bias, instead stating that First Take airs weekdays on ESPN2 at 10 a.m. EST."
Yankees Rookie Nervously Tells A-Rod How Much He Used To Hate Him As A Kid,"TAMPA, FL—Tentatively approaching the All-Star third baseman during a spring training workout Friday, New York Yankees rookie outfielder Tyler Austin reportedly worked up the courage to tell Alex Rodriguez how much he used to hate him as a kid. “Hey, Alex, I’m sure you get this from the younger guys all the time, but I just wanted you to know how much I hated your fucking guts when I was growing up,” Austin told the Yankees slugger, adding that he will “always remember” watching Rodriguez slap the ball out of Bronson Arroyo’s glove in the 2004 ALCS and then later finally admit to years of steroid use in 2009. “I’ll never forget visiting Yankee Stadium with my dad when I was 15, and every time you came up to bat I would just boo and scream “Asshole!” at you as loud as I could. And now we’re sharing the same field—I can hardly believe it.” Austin later expressed his surprise to reporters that Rodriguez is somehow even more of an abhorrent, utterly rage-inducing prick in person."
Bench Players Given Some Time In First Quarter Of Game Against Knicks,"BOSTON—Stressing that it was a good opportunity for younger members of the team to get some valuable experience, Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens reportedly removed his starters and put in bench players during the first quarter of Wednesday night’s game against the New York Knicks. “When you’re already up by this much and only have three quarters left to play, it can’t hurt to give some of these rookies a shot,” said Stevens, adding that he hoped to avoid needlessly running up the score over the final 42 minutes of the game. “There’s no reason to have our starting five out there at this point—the game’s a foregone conclusion, and now we’re just in garbage time. They did enough over those first seven minutes of the game that we might as well have them rest and let some of these guys who haven’t played all year see some action while the pressure is off.” At press time, the Knicks managed to reduce their deficit to a more respectable 20 points after Stevens pulled all but one player off the court for the entirety of the second half."
Miracle On Ice’ Players Wondering If They Can Reunite Somewhere Other Than Lake Placid,"LAKE PLACID, NY—Telling reporters that they would be open to hundreds of other cities and towns across the country, members of the 1980 “Miracle On Ice” U.S. Olympic hockey team openly wondered Wednesday whether their next reunion could be held anywhere other than Lake Placid. “Just out of curiosity, would it be possible for us to celebrate our historic achievement in a city that, I don’t know, has more than a few thousand people and isn’t in the middle of nowhere?” said former captain Mike Eruzione, adding that while there are certainly many great memories associated with the town, he and his teammates have no desire to spend another weekend of their lives wandering around weather-beaten 35-year-old Olympic facilities in the dead of winter. “I hate to say this, but c’mon, this place is a shithole. Maybe we could put on our old Team USA jerseys and get together somewhere warm like Miami or Los Angeles. Hell, even going two hours south to Albany would be a big improvement on this dump.” Eruzione added that the team would happily spend the event’s 40th anniversary in Russia if it meant they would never have to return to Lake Placid again."
Jameis Winston Doesn’t Rule Out Playing Baseball In Prison,"TAMPA, FL—Speaking to reporters Tuesday about potentially continuing as a two-sport athlete after college, Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston refused to rule out the possibility of someday playing baseball in prison. “I’m a football player first and foremost, so that will remain a priority, but it’d be great if I can play both football and baseball while I’m incarcerated,” said Winston, adding that he has the drive and ability to be a multiple-sport athlete for at least several years of his prison sentence. “It’ll depend on how much time I have in the yard each day, and I’ll definitely want to make sure I have the support of my fellow inmates before I commit to anything, but if the circumstances are right, I think I could easily be a top pitcher in whichever penitentiary I end up going to.” Reached for comment, several NFL general managers privately told reporters that any possibility of Winston pursuing baseball in prison would not at all dissuade them from drafting him."
Bellicose Contingent Of Seventh-Graders Want To Play Tackle,"WEST ALLIS, WI—Forcefully asserting that two-hand touch football is “for girls,” reports out of Greenfield Park confirmed Monday that a small but aggressive faction of seventh-graders are staunchly in favor of playing tackle. “C’mon, stop being such babies—let’s play real football,” said the contingent’s de facto leader, 12-year-old Conor Crawford, reportedly growing increasingly combative and confrontational as several of his seventh-grade peers displayed some hesitancy toward the idea. “We can put Brian and Jack on different teams since they’re the biggest, so that way it’ll be fair. Tackle is so much more fun, and it’s not like we’re playing on pavement or something.” At press time, play had halted as the entire group gathered around a crying Brennan Michaels following the game’s kickoff."
76ers Afraid To Kick Bunch Of Tough-Looking Guys Off Practice Court,"PHILADELPHIA—Explaining that the men currently engaged in the four-on-four pickup game are “really big” and “seem kind of mean,” players on the Philadelphia 76ers were reportedly hesitant Friday to kick a group of tough-looking guys off the team’s practice court. “I tried asking them what time they’d be done, but I don’t think they heard me,” said 76ers starting point guard Michael Carter-Williams, adding that his teammates and coaches have been quietly standing on the sidelines of the practice facility for 15 minutes in the hopes that the men would notice and take the hint to finish up. “The court is definitely reserved for us, but I don’t really want to start a whole fuss over it with these guys. At one point, it actually looked like they were done, but they just took a quick water break and then started up a new game with different teams. After this one’s over, I’ll try to see if they’ll let us use half of the court.”"
Man Illegally Streaming Game Fends Off Pop-Up Ads With Surgical Precision,"JACKSON, MI—Navigating through a barrage of new windows and dialog boxes as he attempted to watch a game between the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, sources confirmed Wednesday evening that local man Matt Spriggs successfully fought off pop-up ads on live streaming site Sideline2U.eu with finely tuned, surgical precision. Reportedly undeterred by the message at the bottom of his screen insisting that he install a JavaScript plug-in to continue, the 25-year-old carefully wielded his cursor with pinpoint accuracy while repeatedly locating and clicking the correct red “X” buttons amidst an onslaught of deceptive “Cancel” and “Close Window” options. According to sources, Spriggs was fully aware that a miscalculation by even a fraction of an inch would result in numerous other windows opening all over his screen, but nonetheless continued methodically shutting down ads for AdultFriendFinder.com and Mac cleaner software that had suddenly emerged behind his browser and begun loudly playing audio. At press time, after coming face-to-face with a buffering live video of Canal Plus Sports, Spriggs steeled himself, clicked a link for a different streaming option, and once again plunged fearlessly into the utter chaos that awaited him."
Tim Duncan Raving About Health Benefits Of Standing Bench,"SAN ANTONIO—Explaining that it significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and promotes healthier metabolism, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly spent the majority of practice Wednesday extolling the numerous benefits of switching to a standing bench. “You can still watch the game, cheer for the team, and do everything else you normally do, but it’s so much healthier than sitting,” said Duncan, adding that players who use a traditional bench are far less productive while setting screens on the perimeter or getting down the floor during a fast break. “Sitting for 20 or 30 minutes every game really adds up over the season, and it could end up shortening your career by years. You’d be amazed at how much of a difference standing can even make to your general energy level, especially if you’re someone who tends to sit for long stretches of a half without ever getting up to sub in.” Duncan also urged head coach Gregg Popovich to always use a gel anti-fatigue mat, stressing the importance of providing sturdy, cushioned support for the feet and knees when drawing up plays during a timeout."
New NFL Combine Drill Places Player Alone In Room With Woman,"INDIANAPOLIS— Explaining that the new exercise will help teams more accurately and comprehensively assess draft prospects, NFL representatives confirmed Tuesday that the newest scouting combine drill simply places college players in a small room alone with a woman. “Beginning this year, we’ve begun testing players’ abilities by sitting them down at a table across from a woman between the ages of 20 and 30 years old,” said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello, adding that coaches and scouts carefully evaluate performances during the three-minute timed drill while seated behind a one-way mirror in the examination room. “So far, there haven’t been any real standouts, and we’ve actually had a number of guys who we’ve had to pull from the exercise after just 10 or 15 seconds. This is easily one of the most challenging tests of the week for these young athletes.” Reached for comment, several players privately told reporters that they have not spent any time preparing for the drill, as it is expected to have a very minimal effect on their draft stock."
Missed H.O.R.S.E. Shots Getting Increasingly Ambitious,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—Despite over 10 minutes passing since either player had successfully made a basket, sources at a local public basketball court confirmed Monday that the missed shots of two young men playing H.O.R.S.E. are growing increasingly bold and ambitious. Early reports indicated that even after missing multiple three-pointers from shorter distances, the players continued stepping further back on the court, and spent four consecutive turns launching half-court shots that all bounced off the backboard without even touching the rim. The two individuals have also reportedly called out “Swish!” prior to a number of their shots, including one instance when trying to hit a one-handed turnaround fadeaway from the baseline and another before a behind-the-back shot at the top of the key, both of which resulted in air balls. At press time, one of the players had confidently walked behind the basket for an utterly futile attempt at shooting the ball over the backboard."
Being On Volleyball Team Accounts For 97% Of High School Sophomore’s Identity,"VERONA, WI—Saying that there appears to be little else influencing her personality, sources close to Verona Area High School sophomore Angie Seldon confirmed Friday that 97 percent of the 16-year-old’s identity revolves around being a member of the school’s volleyball team. “It’s hard to describe Angie without bringing up volleyball—pretty much everything she says or does has something to do with playing for the varsity squad,” classmate Peter Berry told reporters, adding that when Seldon isn’t spending her weeknights playing in a volleyball match, she’s usually going to a team pasta dinner night held after practice. “All the clothes she wears usually have a volleyball logo on them or are from some tournament she played in, and I’m pretty sure the only music she listens to is from the playlist their team captains make before every big game. Honestly, if it weren’t for volleyball, I couldn’t even begin to tell you who she is as a person.” Berry went on to say that the remaining 3 percent of Seldon’s personality was clearly defined by her parents’ overbearing, unrealistic expectations of academic and athletic perfection from their daughter."
eBay Shopper Struggling To Narrow Down Vast Selection Of Available Super Bowl Rings,"MCALESTER, OK—Saying that he was having difficulty selecting just one item among all the available options up for bidding, local 34-year-old Carl Aldrich expressed his frustration Wednesday while attempting to narrow down the vast selection of Super Bowl rings currently listed on eBay. “I only want to buy one, but there are just so many to choose from,” Aldrich told reporters, noting that he was deciding between making an opening bid on various championship rings from the 1980 Oakland Raiders and the 1991 Washington Redskins, as well as more than two dozen from the 1972 Miami Dolphins. “It looks like there are a bunch available from the first Super Bowl—I don’t have any of those yet. And I guess I could always buy this one that DSharper42 is selling, but I’ve got so many from the ’09 Saints already.” At press time, Aldrich had decided to just bid for two separate Super Bowl rings from the 1985 Chicago Bears, as he could likely win both auctions while still remaining under his budget of $500."
Resilient Tom Brady Critics Already Looking Ahead To Next Season,"WASHINGTON—After the veteran New England Patriots quarterback secured his record-tying fourth Super Bowl championship and third Super Bowl MVP, scores of Tom Brady’s harshest critics across the nation announced Friday that they are already eagerly looking ahead to next season. “It was a disappointing end to the year, but it’s over now, so it’s time to start laying down next season’s groundwork for why Brady ultimately doesn’t belong in the conversation of the all-time best NFL quarterbacks,” said Pennington, NJ resident Isaac Reynolds, who, along with millions of other tireless Brady detractors, has already turned his attention toward the coming six months of building arguments as to why the Spygate and Deflategate controversies tarnish all of the 37-year-old’s accomplishments. “It’s critical to stay motivated throughout the offseason and focus on any potential weaknesses in Brady’s career, like the fact that Joe Montana’s perfect 4-0 record in Super Bowls clearly means he’s the more clutch player. The important thing to remember is that it’s easy to get complacent—especially after doing this for so long—but you always need to be ready for Brady’s next run of two or three bad games, otherwise you’ll miss an opportunity to argue that he’s too old and should just retire already.” Brady’s critics also reportedly committed to offering up nothing but arduous praise for Peyton Manning in the future, noting that the Denver Broncos quarterback would have undoubtedly won more Super Bowls than Brady if he’d just had better coaches throughout his career."
Delivery Room Nurse Tired Of Taking Shit From Richard Sherman,"SEATTLE—After successfully delivering the newborn baby of Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman and his girlfriend Ashley Moss Thursday morning, Northwest Hospital and Medical Center nurse Karen Greco expressed her frustration at having to constantly take shit from the Seahawks defender throughout the entire birthing process. “As soon as Mr. Sherman showed up to the hospital with his girlfriend, he started shouting about how he was the best in the game and how I wasn’t nothing compared to him,” Greco said, noting how difficult it was to guide Moss through her contractions and apply an epidural anesthetic with the defensive back loudly criticizing the hospital for sending such a “second-rate, bush-league” maternity nurse to deliver his son. “I was trying to concentrate once his girlfriend started crowning, but he was right up in my face and screaming at me the whole time. It’s like, ‘Jesus, just shut up and let me do my job, okay?’” According to sources, Greco and the rest of the maternity ward staff ultimately lost their patience with Sherman when he used his superior size and reach to get in front of the attending obstetrician and snatch his newborn child from his girlfriend’s birth canal."
New England Fans: ‘We Don’t Deserve This’,"BOSTON—Having watched the Patriots win their fourth Super Bowl title in 14 years, sports fans across New England issued a thoughtful and introspective joint statement Wednesday announcing that they in no way deserve any of the success their teams have enjoyed over the past two decades. “When you stop and think about it, we’re loud-mouthed, we’re antagonistic, and we’re unbearably pompous, so there’s really no way we should have been able to enjoy four Super Bowls, three World Series, an NBA title, and a Stanley Cup since 2001,” read the statement in part, which added that “you can think of at least a dozen other fan bases off the top of your head” that would be far better served than Boston with teams that combined for nine different championships over the last 15 years. “The 2004 World Series was really the only thing that you could argue we had coming after waiting almost 100 years since our last one. But considering the way we angrily overreact to the slightest criticism of our teams—always brushing off even warranted criticism as jealousy or resentment—while also whining like crybabies about every little thing that doesn’t go our way, it’s hard to understand how we ended up in this spot. We’re obviously going to enjoy the win over the Seahawks, but let’s be honest here, we all know deep down that we don’t deserve this in the slightest.” At press time, residents of New England collectively decided that showing up to Wednesday’s Super Bowl championship parade would only perpetuate their utterly obnoxious and arrogant persona, leaving Patriots coaches and players to drive through the completely empty and silent streets of downtown Boston."
Nick Saban Returns From 2-Year Recruiting Expedition With 94 Blue-Chip Players,"TUSCALOOSA, AL—Having traversed such unforgiving but target-rich environments as the Texas hill country and the swamplands of the Deep South, University of Alabama head football coach Nick Saban finally returned Wednesday from a two-year recruiting expedition with 94 blue-chip players, sources confirmed. “I spent months patiently tracking some of these All-Americans, but in the end it was worth it,” said Saban, describing the grueling 12,000-mile trek that saw him score such rare and prized prospects as a 350-pound defensive tackle and 13 wide receivers with 4.3 40 times. “It’s all about setting the bait by flashing the national championship rings and promises about playing time, and then you just have to sit and wait. I could’ve easily picked off another dozen three-stars, but honestly I wouldn’t have had room in my pickup for all of them. It was tough being away from my family for so long, although when it was all said and done, this really was the recruiting trip of a lifetime.” Saban declined to comment, however, on allegations that he was caught on Auburn University’s grounds attempting to poach players eligible for a fifth-year transfer."
Nation Prepares For Long Week Of Seeing Photos Of Tom Brady Lifting Super Bowl Trophy,"WASHINGTON—Bracing themselves for what they know will be a long and arduous week, millions of Americans across the nation expressed their frustration Tuesday as they prepared to be continuously inundated with photos of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady lifting the Super Bowl trophy. “Well, this is gonna suck,” Omaha, NE resident Paul Webb said before opening his web browser, explaining that as soon as he opens any given sports website, he will inevitably be met with a giant picture of Brady holding up the Lombardi Trophy after the Super Bowl or during the Patriots’ championship parade. “It’ll be really annoying having to immediately scroll down just so I don’t have to see that smug asshole’s face smiling back at me while he wears a ‘Super Bowl XLIX Champions’ hat and confetti rains down around him, but I guess I don’t have a choice unless I toss my phone in the garbage and go live in the woods for the next seven days. The worst will be those grids of him hoisting four different Super Bowl trophies—Christ, even the thought of that makes me want to fucking puke.” The U.S. populace did, however, reportedly take some solace in realizing that the constant barrage of photos and articles about Brady and the Patriots doesn’t represent a drastic departure from the media’s normal, everyday sports coverage."
God: ‘Fuck Russell Wilson’,"THE HEAVENS—Following the game-ending interception against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, God Almighty, Creator and Supreme Ruler of the Universe, confirmed Monday that He “can’t fucking stand Russell Wilson” and that the Seattle Seahawks star quarterback “can go fuck himself.” “I hate Russell Wilson, so fuck him, and fuck the Seahawks,” said the Heavenly Father, adding that Jermaine Kearse’s incredible catch on Seattle’s final drive was indeed a case of divine intervention, but only so Wilson could then throw an interception that cost his team the Super Bowl. “I mean, the look on his face right after I made him throw that pick on the goal line was just priceless. He’s so fucking annoying, so I wanted to get his hopes up and then crush him in front of the whole world. Self-righteous little prick.” Despite subsequently allowing the Patriots to win their fourth Super Bowl title, God also clarified that Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and Robert Kraft are all “dirty fucking cheats” who will spend an eternity in Hell after they die."
 Patriots Super Bowl Win Provides Storybook Ending To NFL Credibility,"GLENDALE, AZ—Having defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday night to win Super Bowl XLIX, the New England Patriots reportedly provided an incredible storybook ending to the NFL’s credibility. “Honestly, you couldn’t have scripted it any better in a movie,” said ESPN analyst Adam Schefter, adding that after a year rife with scandal—including high-profile domestic violence cases involving Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson, the league’s ongoing concussion epidemic, and fresh allegations of cheating against New England—seeing the Patriots celebrate a fourth Super Bowl title was a fitting end to the NFL’s integrity. “Given what we’ve seen over the past six months, this is the perfect way—really the only way—for it to finish. Unbelievable.” Sources also confirmed that witnessing a smiling Roger Goodell hand the Lombardi Trophy to Patriots owner Robert Kraft was just the cherry on top after watching the final few seconds of the NFL’s dignity and self-respect tick away."
Bill Belichick Credits Victory To His God,"GLENDALE, AZ—After defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday to win his fourth Super Bowl title, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick took a moment to credit the landmark victory to his god. “We’ve had to endure a lot to get to this point, but it just goes to show that all things are made possible through Y’golonac,” Belichick told reporters as he stood on the trophy stage, emphasizing that his strong relationship with Y’golonac, the Defiler, has given him the strength to get to where he is today. “Win or lose, I’m humbled by all of the Great Old One’s blessings. I’m just thankful that today the great and almighty Y’golonac gave me what it took to win. Thank you, my lord and savior.” At press time, Belichick reportedly knelt down to lead the Patriots in a team prayer, after which the ground inside University of Phoenix Stadium began to tremble."
Puppy Bowl Overshadowed By League’s Rampant Heartworm Pill Abuse,"NEW YORK—As evidence mounts linking unregulated usage of the prescription medication to a variety of degenerative health issues, sources confirmed Sunday that Puppy Bowl XI is being increasingly overshadowed by the league’s rampant heartworm pill abuse. “The debilitating long-term effects of heartworm pills on puppies who abused them in their playing days are unfortunately only beginning to be understood,” said Slate editor Anthony Isaacson, adding that the intense buildup for this year’s Puppy Bowl falls against the backdrop of 14-week-old star labrador Bailey having been recently rushed to an animal hospital after being discovered in his dog bed severely vomiting and suffering convulsions from an apparent overdose of Heartgard Plus. “Puppies are often supplied heartworm pills by team veterinarians without any regard to the potential future health hazards down the road when they are 4 or 5 years old. Puppy football may be the country’s most adorable sport, but people must realize that it can be an ugly one as well.” Reached for comment, Animal Planet representatives refused to respond to allegations of widespread heartworm pill use, only stating that Puppy Bowl XI is “poised to be one of the cutest Puppy Bowls of all time.”"
"‘The NFL Is Deeply Concerned About Domestic Violence,’ Thinks Local Moron","FORT WAYNE, IN—Following the airing of a public service announcement Sunday expressing the NFL’s stance against domestic violence, sources confirmed that local man and total fucking moron Timothy Worley, 34, concluded that the league is deeply concerned about domestic violence. “Domestic abuse is clearly an issue the NFL not only cares about, but is also fully committed to addressing,” the dimwitted, unbelievably naïve dipshit reportedly thought after watching the 30-second commercial, noting how impressed he was that the league was willing to make such a strong statement right in the middle of the Super Bowl. “Anyone who watched that PSA can tell that the NFL is willing to go to any lengths to raise awareness about this difficult topic. The ad is just part of that effort, and I’m sure that domestic violence is something it will continue to passionately fight against in the future as well. I’m just glad the NFL is such an upstanding and socially conscious organization.” The totally gullible dumbfuck then confirmed that, based on the PSA, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell undoubtedly believes there are some things far more important than football."
Responsible Gambler Builds Diverse Portfolio Of Super Bowl Prop Bets,"LAS VEGAS—Emphasizing the importance of evenly distributing wagers in order to optimize potential earnings, 34-year-old veteran gambler Eric Whitman told reporters Sunday that he always makes sure to build a diverse portfolio of Super Bowl-related prop bets every year. “A lot of rookie gamblers make the mistake of just dropping their entire bankroll on whichever team they think will win, but you’re running a huge risk if you don’t take advantage of all the side action that most sports books offer these days,” said Whitman, outlining a wide range of prop bets on the total score, whether the game will go to overtime, and which team will kick the first field goal—as well as more conservative positions on whether New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will wear a sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off—that make up the approximately $18,000 in his Super Bowl XLIX gambling portfolio. “The important thing is not to get vested too heavily in any given position. For example, parlays are well and good, but remember that those are long odds bets that can’t be relied on to pay off. It’s better to compensate with safer wagers, such as whether Russell Wilson will have a rushing touchdown in the first quarter or what song Katy Perry will begin the halftime show with. You don’t want to get too reckless.” Whitman added that under no circumstance should a gambler purchase half points to cushion a favorite against the spread unless it’s a sure thing."
Bar Patron Can’t Believe He’s Partying With Rob Gronkowski 15 Minutes Before Kickoff,"GLENDALE, AZ—Admittedly shocked to be seeing the three-time Pro Bowler in person, local 31-year-old Jason Howe expressed his astonishment Sunday after partying at the same bar with New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski just 15 minutes before the kickoff of Super Bowl XLIX. “He’s been here for three hours ordering shots for everyone in the place—I think he even showed up by himself,” said Howe, shouting over the other bar patrons’ raucous cheers as a shirtless Gronkowski pulled himself up onto the bar and began chugging a bottle of Jägermeister. “I’ve never seen anyone throw back so many drinks in a row. I think the bartenders cut him off a few minutes ago, but he doesn’t look like he’s stopping anytime soon. The guy’s a machine.” At press time, a bleary-eyed and profusely sweating Gronkowski was spotted being led out of the establishment in handcuffs and into the back of a police cruiser just as captains of the Patriots and Seahawks met at midfield for the pregame coin toss."
Katy Perry Drops Hints That Super Bowl Halftime Show Will Be Awful,"PHOENIX—Stressing that she didn’t want to divulge too much information about the upcoming performance, pop star Katy Perry dropped several hints at a press conference Friday indicating that this weekend’s Super Bowl XLIX halftime show will be completely awful. “I don’t want to give anything away, but I will say this: Come halftime on Sunday, you better be ready to see the absolute worst, most god-awful piece of garbage you could possibly imagine,” said a smiling Perry, cryptically adding that fans could expect to see several surprise guests join her for “some lame duet performance that no one would ever want to see or hear in a million years.” “I can’t wait for you guys to see what Lenny [Kravitz] and I have planned, because you’ll be blown away at just how unbelievably terrible it is. The whole thing is going to be one giant, extremely over-the-top, 12-minute-long, pathetic excuse for entertainment that will be totally unwatchable. Trust me, you’re going to hate it—just absolutely hate it.” Despite guaranteeing that this Sunday’s halftime show will easily be one of the worst of all time, Perry did admit that it will be difficult to top last year’s giant heap of dog shit starring Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
Patriots Really Embracing ‘Us Against The Rules’ Mentality,"PHOENIX—Amid widespread criticism over using illegally under-inflated footballs in the AFC Championship Game, coaches and players from the New England Patriots revealed Thursday that they are fully embracing an “Us Against The Rules” mentality heading into Super Bowl XLIX. “At the end of the day, that ‘Us Against The Rules’ attitude just motivates us to go out there and play our game the way we do best,” said quarterback Tom Brady, praising his team’s ability to pull together in the face of all the standard rules and regulations in the NFL. “But honestly, it feels like it’s us against the rules every season. It certainly felt that way during all the other Super Bowls we’ve played in, and after a while you just have to own it. It’s not always easy, but it’s just part of playing for the New England Patriots.” Brady went on to credit the mindset for inspiring the team’s past success, noting that it is that much more satisfying when the Patriots come out on top."
"Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, A-Rod Spring To Patriots’ Defense Over Deflated Footballs","NEW YORK—Calling the recent scandal nothing more than a witch hunt, famed athletes Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, and Alex Rodriguez issued a joint statement Tuesday vehemently defending the New England Patriots against accusations that the team cheated by using deflated footballs in last week’s AFC Championship Game. “First and foremost, it is irresponsible for anyone to lobby accusations such as these without indisputable proof,” read the statement, which echoed the official stances of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Marion Jones, Ryan Braun, Luis Suarez, Ben Johnson, Tim Donaghy, and the entire roster of the 1972 U.S.S.R. Olympic basketball team, all of whom have also staunchly come out in support of the Patriots this week. “It could have been the cold weather, or it easily could have been the result of breaking the balls in during warmups. Plus, what advantage could it have possibly provided? They were heavy favorites to win in the first place. Regardless, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady gave us their word that they had no knowledge of any tampering and, quite frankly, that should be enough.” The statement concluded that, should the Patriots be found guilty, one black mark would certainly not invalidate all of their past achievements."
Marshawn Lynch Delivers Eloquent 45-Minute Address On Privacy In The Modern Age,"PHOENIX—Explaining his position on the sociological issue during a Tuesday press conference at Super Bowl Media Day, Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch reportedly delivered an incredibly thoughtful and eloquent 45-minute address on the topic of privacy in the 21st century. “While increasingly exhaustive access to media has delivered many benefits to the American way of life, this same heightened scrutiny has simultaneously imposed progressively greater obstacles to our personal privacy, thus presenting ethical challenges unique to the internet age,” said the five-time Pro Bowler, calmly strolling back and forth with a microphone in hand while making eye contact with each individual member of the assembled national sports media. “Privacy versus accessibility; secrecy versus convenience; the individual versus the greater virtual communities of the digital landscape. At first blush, these appear to be the fundamental poles around which the modern privacy debate circles, but they have only grown more multifaceted and complex as the technological paradigm perpetually shifts. When meditating on the give-and-take of ever-evolving technology, I am often reminded of a quote from George Orwell: ‘Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.’ Could it be, in perhaps the ultimate irony, that with every technological advancement, with every marvel of engineering that seemingly brings us closer together and rips down the very walls that once divided the world, that with every such step forward, we have become ever more guarded about our own personal boundaries and the information we are comfortable sharing with one another? And in doing so, do we in fact chip away at the very core of what makes for a civilized society, and in an even broader sense, the very notion of being human? For to be human is inherently to be social, and yet it is also to desire control. With the public domain seemingly encompassing a greater and greater volume of personal information, that control has been ceded. The so-called right to privacy, as it were, is no longer a right inasmuch as it is now a privilege, to be enjoyed until it is torn away at a moment’s notice. Conversely, we so often desire to break down that same right to privacy of our fellow human beings, shielding ourselves while exposing others, just as a snake devours its own tail. Perhaps the biggest question of all is whether privacy itself—at least in the traditional sense—even exists in today’s world, or if it is simply a relic of a past time that bears no more meaning or significance than Aristotelian physics or the idea of a geocentric universe. Simple answers to such queries do not exist, I’m afraid, but in exploring them, we can at the very least hold a mirror to society and possibly even to ourselves—and that is something I hope to accomplish with all of you here today.” Following his lengthy treatise, Lynch stressed that he was only capable of delivering a cursory examination of such an extensive issue during his allotted time and urged those in attendance to contact him with any questions if they wished to discuss the matter in greater depth."
Fascinating Man Went To Same High School As Professional Athlete,"YORK, PA—Enthralling all those around him with the riveting details of his past, sources confirmed Monday that 24-year-old Kevin Laver, a totally and utterly fascinating man, actually attended the same high school as professional basketball player Gordon Hayward. “Yeah, Gordon was in my grade, and we actually had a biology class together sophomore year,” said the captivating man, who only added further intrigue to his unbelievably interesting backstory upon mentioning that Hayward was “really tall, even back then.” “He was obviously the best player on the basketball team, and everyone basically knew he was going to the NBA. One of my buddies was on the team with him, and apparently they still text each other once in a while.” In a further demonstration of his undeniable value as a human being, Laver added that he saw Hayward at a shopping mall two years ago while visiting home for the holidays, but didn’t talk to him."
New NCAA Regulations Prohibit Student-Athletes From Studying More Than 30 Hours Per Week,"INDIANAPOLIS—Hailing the importance of maintaining a proper balance between education and sports, the NCAA announced new regulations Friday prohibiting student-athletes from dedicating more than 30 hours each week to studying. “Effective immediately, student-athletes are restricted to engaging in academically-related activities for a maximum of four hours each day,” said NCAA president Mark Emmert, noting that the new “30/10-hour” rule limits the amount of time players may spend in classrooms, libraries, and other educational facilities to 30 hours per week during the semester and 10 hours per week over summer break. “Attending lectures, completing coursework, and seeking additional tutoring will all be counted toward the weekly cap, and individuals failing to abide by this new protocol will be required to scale back their hours until they are once again eligible to study.” Emmert added that any student-athlete found in violation of the new protocol could receive an indefinite ban from participating in all course examinations and final projects."
NFL Braces For Record-Low Pro Bowl Player Attendance,"PHOENIX—With league executives preparing themselves for the sight of half-empty sidelines on Saturday, sources confirmed Thursday that the NFL is quietly bracing for a record low in player attendance at this year’s Pro Bowl. “Based on our current data, we expect less than one quarter of players will show up to the University of Phoenix Stadium this weekend,” said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello, noting that the unnecessary risk of injury, lack of intensity, and overall meaninglessness of the game have contributed to the steady decline in the number of players who choose to come to the game each year. “We’ve made an effort to revamp the event in order to generate a higher rate of interest among Pro Bowlers, but it appears the majority will remain at home on Saturday. However, we’re still optimistic that coaching attendance will remain as high as in past years.” Aiello added that the NFL players who do show up will likely head for the exits once the game becomes a blowout in the third quarter."
Nation Can’t Wait To Hear Patriots Fans’ Excuses This Time,"WASHINGTON—After an NFL investigation revealed that 11 of New England’s 12 game balls were under-inflated during last weekend’s AFC Championship Game, Americans across the nation announced Wednesday that they would love—absolutely love—to hear the excuses from Patriots fans this time. “No, no, by all means, go ahead,” said every single person living outside of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut before reportedly smiling and adding, “I’m all ears.” “Wait, let me guess: The deflated footballs were also easier to catch for the Colts defense, so the Patriots didn’t have a real advantage, right? Or is it that the score was so lopsided that it didn’t matter in the end? No, seriously, I’m sure you guys have something really great cooked up for this one.” The American populace went on to say that they also absolutely cannot wait to hear how this new scandal will have no effect on the legacy of Tom Brady."
Doug Baldwin Sick Of Being Disrespected By Statistics,"SEATTLE—Following his team’s 28-22 win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game, Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin expressed his frustration to reporters Wednesday after feeling constantly disrespected by his statistics this season. “These receiving numbers have been coming out of the woodwork after every game and trying to make me look bad, and I’m sick and tired of it,” said a visibly upset Baldwin, adding that such statistics as his 66 receptions, 12.5 yards per reception, and three touchdowns on the season have worked ruthlessly to deride and undermine him throughout the year. “All I have to do is open up any sports website on Monday morning to see all these stats saying my 825 total receiving yards ranks 42nd among NFL players. It’s hard not to take that stuff personally, and after a while you just have to ignore it.” Baldwin went on to express his gratitude to Seahawks coach Pete Carroll for disregarding all incendiary criticism from the receiver’s numbers and continuing to make him a starter throughout the playoffs"
Tom Brady: ‘Joe Montana Sucks And I Am Better Than Him’,"FOXBOROUGH, MA—After surpassing Joe Montana last weekend to claim the all-time NFL record for most postseason touchdown passes, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady told reporters Friday that Montana “sucks total shit” and that he himself is “way, way better” than the retired San Francisco 49ers legend. “Joe Montana is terrible, and I’m a much better quarterback than he ever was,” said Brady, noting that it felt particularly good to break Montana’s record and prove that he is far superior to “that talentless bum.” “And while we’re on the subject: John Elway sucks; Roger Staubach sucks; Terry Bradshaw sucks; Troy Aikman sucks; Dan Marino sucks; Steve Young sucks; Bart Starr sucks; and Johnny Unitas sucks. They all suck compared to me. They’re terrible quarterbacks, and I’m a great quarterback—the greatest quarterback who ever lived. Me. I’m the best.” Brady went on to say that although the Patriots are unquestionably the best football team of all time, it is only because of his own contributions, and that he would have been able to achieve just as much without any of his teammates or coaches."
John Elway Casually Mentions To Peyton Manning How Great It Was Going Out On Top In ’98,"DENVER—Saying that it was the absolute perfect way to end his Hall of Fame career, Denver Broncos general manager John Elway casually mentioned to Peyton Manning just how great it was to go out on top as a Super Bowl champion in 1998, sources confirmed Friday. “You know, walking off the field for the last time as a world champion was really something else,” said Elway, adding that not much could ever top being hoisted onto his teammates’ shoulders as the last seconds of his career ticked away, not to mention the fact that it is the image most NFL fans will forever associate with him and his legacy. “Obviously, winning one Super Bowl was great, but getting two back-to-back was just incredible. And it felt especially amazing after always coming so close and hearing people say for years that I choked when it really mattered. Oh, and riding off into the sunset as a member of the same team that I played my whole career with? Yeah, I’d definitely say that was pretty special.” Elway reportedly added to Manning that walking away from the game on his own terms with perfect health was equally, if not more satisfying."
Dick LeBeau Confident He Still Has 30 Or 40 Years Of Coaching Left In Him,"PITTSBURGH—Following his unexpected resignation from the Pittsburgh Steelers last week, veteran defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau told reporters Thursday that he still feels he can coach in the NFL for at least another 30 or 40 years. “I feel good, I’m healthy, and I’m still as motivated as ever, so I think I still have another three or four decades of coaching at the highest level in the tank,” said the 77-year-old LeBeau, adding that while retirement has occasionally crossed his mind, he is determined to continue working on the sidelines for several dozen more years. “I could easily see myself going through the 2045 season, and then I’ll probably reevaluate things after that. I won’t go on forever, obviously, but as long as I find the right team and organization, I’d be happy to keep coaching for the next half century or so.” LeBeau went on to say that regardless of which team he joins next, he is still setting his sights on winning at least 25 more Super Bowl rings before ending his coaching career."
Report: Peyton Manning Played Entire Season With 38-Year-Old Body,"DENVER—After a lackluster performance in his team’s playoff loss to the Indianapolis Colts, reports emerged Wednesday that Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning played the entire 2014 season with a 38-year-old body. “Many had suspected something was wrong as Manning’s numbers dipped during the second half of the season, but he was able to hide the precise nature of his 38-year-old body from coaches, teammates, and the media,” said ESPN’s Adam Schefter, adding that the team’s midseason shift to a more run-heavy offense was made in an effort to keep the 14-time Pro Bowler from further aggravating his nearly-four-decades-old bones, tendons, and musculature. “Manning was often seen grimacing on the sidelines and was visibly frustrated at being hampered by a 38-year-old body during games. But the situation unfortunately only worsened as he tried to play through it.” Reached for comment, sources from the Broncos medical staff expressed pessimism over Manning’s future, warning that he will put himself at significant risk if he opts to play next season with a 39-year-old body."
Graduating Seniors Somber After Being Financially Exploited On Field For Last Time,"ARLINGTON, TX—Following Ohio State’s 42-20 victory over Oregon in Monday’s inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship, graduating seniors from both teams were admittedly somber after being financially exploited on the field for the last time in their collegiate careers. “I don’t think it really sunk in until after the game ended, but it’s hard knowing this was the last time I’ll ever go out there and be completely taken advantage of by an incredibly wealthy institution earning millions upon millions of dollars whenever I play,” said senior Oregon center Hroniss Grasu, who was visibly saddened when describing his final appearance as a pawn used to make enormous profits for his coaches, school officials, and the NCAA without earning a single cent in return. “You never think the day will come when you won’t be able to sacrifice your body on Saturdays for no pay whatsoever while your school generates incredible amounts of money off your back. I’m just glad I really cherished it while it lasted.” Grasu added, however, that he is excited to play in the NFL next season, where his contract can be immediately voided as soon as he suffers a career-threatening injury."
Les Miles Assures Recruits’ Parents His Players Are Like Sons He Can Cut At Any Time,"BATON ROUGE, LA—While speaking to several potential Louisiana State University football recruits Monday, head coach Les Miles reportedly reassured the high schoolers’ parents that he considers the players on his team like his own sons whom he can cut from the team anytime he wants. “These boys aren’t just pieces on my roster—I treat them like my very own flesh and blood and won’t hesitate to cut them at the drop of a hat if they start underperforming,” Miles said to the mother of LSU Tigers quarterback prospect Jerome Fielding, emphasizing that he cares for his student-athletes much in the same way a father would care for his children whom he would immediately dismiss in the event one of them was injured or hit his athletic ceiling earlier than expected. “Rest assured, Mrs. Fielding, if Jerome chooses LSU, he won’t just be getting a great education and the opportunity to play for a top football program; he’ll become part of a new family. A family who, if he has a bad week, or if another family member comes along with better field vision and quicker feet in the pocket, won’t hesitate in the slightest to throw him on the bench for the rest of the season, after which he’ll be kicked out of the family and lose his scholarship.” Reached for comment, several current LSU players told reporters that they themselves consider Miles a father figure whose contract will likely be bought out if the Tigers don’t go at least 10-2 this season."
CBS To Feature In-Studio Fan To Provide Partially Correct Explanations Of Refs’ Calls,"NEW YORK—In an effort to provide additional insight into the league’s many complex rules and regulations, officials from CBS announced Friday that the network’s NFL coverage will now feature the analysis of an in-studio fan who will offer partially correct explanations for every contentious refereeing decision. “Through the rest of the playoffs, we’ll have a longtime NFL fan standing by in New York who possesses, at best, a tentative grasp on NFL rules to offer long-winded, rambling assessments of officiating calls,” said NFL On CBS executive producer Lance Barrow, noting that the middle-aged fan will appear via satellite to interpret complicated calls such as intentional grounding, pass interference, and illegal contact with varying degrees of inaccuracy. “Whenever a play is under review, the fan will offer his take, which will inevitably blur the line between college and pro rules, contradict an earlier explanation he gave for an identical play, or demonstrate a very clear bias toward one team, often ending with loud accusations that the ref is a dumbass who must be fucking blind.” Barrow went on to assure viewers that the fan’s explanations will be no more confusing, nonsensical, or irritating than those of CBS’ regular team of color commentators and studio analysts."
Speculation Mounting Over Which Fired NFL Head Coaches To Be Emasculated As Coordinators Next Season,"NEW YORK—With several names circulating as possibilities for the unique brand of public humiliation, speculation continued to mount Thursday over which recently fired NFL head coaches will be utterly emasculated by working as coordinators next season. “As teams begin assembling their staffs for next year, it remains to be seen whether the likes of Mike Smith will have to swallow their pride and accept a position where they will pathetically wield a mere 10 percent of their former power, authority, and prestige,” said ESPN NFL analyst Adam Schefter, adding that league sources are “fairly confident” in former Raiders coach Dennis Allen debasing himself as a defensive coordinator, for which he must humbly follow the orders of another head coach who was once his peer. “We know that several teams feel they could benefit from taking someone who once managed every aspect of an entire organization with total autonomy and then relegating him to the oversight of an offense or defense. There are even rumblings that at least one former head coach will pitifully spend a season taking orders from a current head coach who actually used to be his assistant.” At press time, sources confirmed that former Bears coach Marc Trestman will likely be forced to endure the ultimate embarrassment of taking a job as a quarterbacks coach."
Man Who Spent 300 Hours Playing Fantasy Football This Year Rewarded With $30 Second-Place Payout,"ALBANY, NY—Having barely lost in the championship game against his former college roommate, local 28-year-old Tim Beaumont, a man who spent roughly 300 hours playing fantasy football this year, was reportedly rewarded for his efforts Tuesday with a $30 second-place payout. “I’m a little disappointed I couldn’t go all the way, but at least I ended up winning 30 bucks,” said Beaumont, who reportedly spent an average of 90 minutes each day comparing players’ stats, monitoring the waiver wire, and emailing his friends about potential trades. “That injury to Le’Veon Bell against the Bengals really killed me. But you know what, I made back my money from the league buy-in, and I have some bragging rights over the other guys. It was a good season.” At press time, sources confirmed that after spending over $900 while watching NFL games at a local bar every Sunday, Beaumont plans to use his runner-up prize to purchase a used Xbox 360 controller."
Fox Introduces New Line Of Scrimmage Reporter For NFL Playoffs,"LOS ANGELES—Claiming that the new addition to their broadcast will bring fans closer to the game than ever before, officials from Fox Sports confirmed Friday that the network is debuting line of scrimmage reporters for all of its NFL playoff games. “Beginning with Wild Card Weekend, our line of scrimmage reporters will be positioned right in the middle of the neutral zone in order to provide viewers with the most in-depth and up-to-date information on what’s happening before the snap,” said Fox Sports president Eric Shanks, adding that the reporters will shed valuable insight into the quarterback’s cadence, audibles on either side of the ball, and any trash talk during the 40 seconds between each play. “For the first time ever, fans will be given live updates from a source standing just inches away from the center as he tries to read the opposing defense. And once the ball is snapped, our commentators will check back in with our reporter to get a firsthand look at how a hole or passing pocket is developing.” Shanks added that the network is also currently experimenting with a sky reporter, who, while suspended from a thin wire running the length of the field, will provide real-time analysis of plays from an aerial position."
Athlete’s Heartwarming Story Fucking Sucks,"INDIANAPOLIS—Sources from across the nation confirmed Friday that the heartwarming story of Indianapolis Colts scout team player Marcus Newsome, a 31-year-old linebacker who realized his NFL dream five years after being diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease, totally fucking sucks. “Frankly, Marcus’ whole against-all-odds narrative does absolute jack shit to inspire me,” said 28-year-old Denver native Joe Mackie, adding that Newsome eventually earning an NFL contract despite doctors telling him he’d never play football again is, at best, a fucking lame and totally derivative imitation of Magic Johnson. “From start to finish, the whole thing just blows. He was in treatment for barely over a year, so it’s not like he was on the verge of death before clawing his way back to the top—that would have at least made me believe anything is possible through self-belief, willpower, and determination. Either show up with an incredibly moving story of courage in the face of adversity or don’t even come to the table. Just don’t waste my time with some hackneyed crap I’ve already heard a hundred times before. What an asshole.” Sources later speculated that pretty much the only way Newsome’s story wouldn’t completely suck shit would be if he eventually won a Super Bowl just days after one of his parents tragically passed away following a brave, protracted battle with cancer."
Report: Jets Players Lied About Concussion Symptoms To Get Out Of Games,"NEW YORK—Bringing further attention to the NFL’s ongoing struggles with head-trauma-related issues, an anonymous survey published Thursday by ESPN revealed that multiple players from the New York Jets lied about suffering from concussion symptoms to get out of games this season. “Of 43 Jets players surveyed, over 30 admitted to having actively misled sideline doctors by complaining of severe nausea and blinding headaches in order to avoid going back out on the field,” said ESPN reporter Evan Thompson, adding that several players confessed to feigning a momentary loss of consciousness after a jarring hit so they could remain on the sideline for the rest of the game. “Among players who admitted to lying to coaches and team doctors, almost all claimed to having done so more than once over the course of this season, with many going to incredible lengths to stay in the locker room during games against a division rival. Most worrying, however, is that when asked if they would do it again, every player unanimously said yes.” The report’s findings also indicated that, despite their best efforts, every Jets player in question was forced to retake the field and finish the game anyway."
Lakers Confident They Just Need Another Once-In-A-Generation Player To Get Back On Track,"LOS ANGELES—Despite his team’s dismal start to the NBA season, Los Angeles Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak told reporters Wednesday that he believes the franchise only needs to add another once-in-a-generation player to get back on track. “I can certainly understand the pessimism among Lakers fans right now, but we’ll be able to right the ship if we can just find that one guy who will eventually rank among the best 20 NBA players of all time,” said Kupchak, adding that the team could easily return to championship contention if it simply drafts a 19-year-old phenom whose photo is printed on the cover of Sports Illustrated under the headline, “The Next Michael Jordan.” “The foundation is in place, and now it’s just a matter of adding a future first-ballot Hall of Famer who will put up 30,000 points over 20 years in the league and single-handedly take over games through unbelievable skill and athleticism, uncompromising competitiveness, and sheer willpower. If we can just get that missing piece, then we’ll be right back in the thick of things.” Reached for comment, Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant dismissed Kupchak’s claims, adamantly telling reporters that the roster already has a transcendent, generation-defining player at the peak of his powers."
Jon Gruden Impressed By Every Blade Of Grass On Football Field,"GREEN BAY, WI—Hailing their contribution to the game as “extraordinary” and “totally underrated,” ESPN Monday Night Football commentator Jon Gruden was reportedly full of praise for every single blade of grass at Lambeau Field during tonight’s matchup between the Falcons and Packers. “Now, that’s a blade of grass right there—it’s not the biggest on the field, but it stands tall when it matters, and it’s got all the things you look for in a solid, reliable blade of grass,” Gruden said of a 1.8-inch grass stem situated near the 15-yard line, raving that each of the roughly 61 million Kentucky bluegrass reeds collectively make up “the best tandem of grass in the National Football League, no question.” “I love what I’m seeing out there—tough, no-nonsense, old-school blades of grass. People might say they just came up out of nowhere, but listen, it’s no surprise to anyone who saw how good those seedlings were looking back in September. And I’ll tell you something else, they’ve only gotten stronger since then. If I were the Packers, I would be very, very happy with where those sprouts are at right now.” Gruden went on to say that the hash mark at Lambeau Field’s 46-yard line possesses the same amazing qualities as the Los Angeles Coliseum goal line of the late 1980s."
No One At CBS Remembers Hiring O.J. Simpson As Color Commentator,"NEW YORK—Claiming that their hiring protocol for on-air talent is usually very meticulous, sources at CBS confirmed Sunday that no one within the network can actually remember deciding to hire O.J. Simpson as a color commentator. “He showed up wearing a CBS Sports blazer, grabbed a mic, and just headed into the broadcast booth, so I assume somebody must have cleared him to call today’s Ravens-Dolphins game at some point,” NFL On CBS coordinating producer Lance Barrow told reporters, emphasizing that neither he nor his colleagues could recall the chain of events that led to them offering an on-air color analyst position to the retired Buffalo Bills running back and former Heisman Trophy winner. “I checked with the executive producers and none of them remember hiring him either, so I’m not really sure what happened. The thing is, O.J. is actually a really good analyst—he clearly does a lot of research before the games and has a great voice for TV. I guess we’ll just see where this goes.” At press time, a laughing Simpson was reportedly trading jokes with Jim Nantz in the broadcast booth before checking in with The NFL Today host James Brown for an update on the Rams-Redskins game."
Wife Kept Up All Night By Kevin Garnett Talking Trash In Sleep,"NEW YORK—Saying she has still not grown accustomed to the irritating habit despite being married to the Brooklyn Nets power forward for a decade, Brandi Garnett revealed to reporters that she was once again kept up the whole night Thursday by her husband talking trash in his sleep. “I must have woken up four different times from Kevin tossing and turning in bed while calling someone a little bitch who can’t fucking score on him,” said Garnett, adding that although she tries her best to simply tune out the unconscious trash talking, it generally occurs multiple times per night and can continue for 30 or 40 minutes on end. “At one point I actually thought something was wrong, but then I saw his eyes were shut and he was snoring in between reflexively pounding his chest and mumbling God knows what about an opposing player’s wife. The worst was when he screamed ‘Get that shit out of here!’ at the top of his lungs around four in the morning—I’m honestly surprised he didn’t wake himself up.” Garnett went on to explain that her husband never has any recollection the next day of having talked trash in his sleep, though he often seamlessly continues cursing out Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah as soon as he wakes up."
