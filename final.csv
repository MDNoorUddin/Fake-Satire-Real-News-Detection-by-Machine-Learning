"World leaders have refused to condemn Iran after the damning evidence that it had shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet headed to Ukraine and Canada in what appears to have been a clumsy response to the drone strike by the US military against a Quds General.


 
In what appears to be a woke attempt at not upsetting the Iranian leadership and its people, who have held daily angry demonstrations chanting �Death to the rest of the world�, the leaders of Canada, the US and France have indicated that they accept that Iran (which previously denied shooting down the plane) is a nice, peaceful country which doesn�t want to hurt anyone and it was all a big, embarrassing mistake.

Cynics have questioned whether this view is an unfair and cruel fiction, intended, laudibly, to avoid escalating tensions in the Middle East, but, wrongly dismissing the 167 passengers on the plane as simply victims of an accident, who were inconveniently in the wrong place at the wrong time rather than victims of murder.

Meanwhile, Iran, itself, blamed America for the deaths of the passengers, saying they died as a result of �American adventurism� but refusing to be more specific."
"Supposedly passed away on January 21,1950, this information is incorrect.US Special Forces kidnapped Orwell from the UK on January 20, 1950, and confined him in a basement dungeon at The White House.
However, shortly afterwards, he slipped away and eventually joined the more than half million homeless in America living under bridges and alongside ditches, in tent cities here and there.
According to scholars now dogging this case, Mr. Orwell has lost none of his visionary thinking.
In fact, it may have been enhanced due to his enjoyment of certain substances.
He has recently tweeted: �I can no longer keep silent. Look for more directly.�Mr. Pompeo responded: �This man is second only to Soleimani as a threat to this country, and the free world! The bad guy we just exterminated!�
Mr. Trump came on, with a certain dreamy-sounding tone in his voice, as though somebody had hypnotized him:�Under my leadership . . . we have spent trillions of dollars . . . to create the greatest military . . . the world has ever seen . . . What�s that? Who?�Mr. Pompeo stamped his foot:�We have drone activity on this problem as we speak! Mr. Orwell or whatever his name is had better get his flameproof armor on and avoid all commercial flights out of the country!�Audio from one of Mr. Orwell�s locales indicates he had a response, with sound quality somewhat unclear--�Pass the bong!� could have been �Watch out for that dung!�Whatever, Mr. Orwell�s baritone at this point was unmistakable:�War is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength.�
Mr. Trump: �Who is this guy? Pompey, say something!�Mr. Pompeo: �This is preposterous! The United States is a peace-loving nation which seeks nothing more than stability and promoting other nations in various regions of the world.zPlus: ""And according to their interests, not ours!""
Mr. Orwell (with the sound of applause and �Yo, baby!� in the background):
�And the stock market�oil and munitions specifically�has nothing to do with the US State Department�s foreign policy.�

Mr. Trump: �You see? Now he�s getting it! Am I good for the economy or what?�"
"Yesterday, opposition leader Juan Guaido attempted to climb over a fence around the National Assembly Building in Caracas, Venezuela.


 
A vote was taking place to replace him as Speaker with former Guaido supporter, Luis Parra.

A year ago, Guaido announced himself the true and only president of Venezuela under the sponsorship of US Vice-President Pence.

Maduro disagreed, due to an election verified by the international community.

More than 60% in the election favored him of a 40% plus turnout.

Only 8% of Venezuelans had heard of Guaido previously.

The struggle at the fence around the National Assembly Building took place between Guaido and security forces to keep him out.

With a wild crowd surrounding, Mr. Guaido grappled to the top of the fence and was warded off.

In the process he sustained a large rip in the seat of his trousers, which he later took selfies of, as incontrovertible evidence of his violation.

He was accompanied by US advisor Elliott Abrams, who helped sponsor his efforts to take over from Maduro last year, and who was also snarled on the fence.

Interviewed on CNN Mr. Abrams responded:

""My dingleberry was extended (thanks to Mr. Guaido and his camera we have documentary photos of this) but it's all right now."""
"A military drone today took out several rooms of the world renowned Mar-a-Lago. The target? The most insidious weapon ever deployed by Iran, a large Madagascar hissing cockroach.


 
""It was spotted by Mrs Trump in the laboratory of their master bedroom,"" said a Secret Service agent, on condition of anonymity. Mr Trump asked Pompeo and he gave him a menu of four options.

1. Swat the offending roach with a newspaper; 2. Hit it with a golf club; 3. Let it chase Melania around the room naked and shoot a video to blackmail her with; 4. Have it taken out with a military drone, but evacuate at least two city blocks ahead of time.

""I have taken the only appropriate action to save my family!"" tweeted Trump. ""To save us from war with Iran!""

""This was in no way self-serving, as some Democrats have suggested that I was merely trying to save my ass with Melania! It bit her on the ass.....well, it ain't important that it bit her on the butt.""

Secretary of State Pompeass stated, ""This action by this President prevented World War 3, and only cost the lives of a few illegal immigrants. We all live in a safer world today because of his brave actions here today!"""
"
Major news organizations such as Reuters are reporting that Melania, Jared, and Ivanka have declined Mr. Trump's invitation to accompany him to Baghdad this coming weekend.


 
Mr. Pompeo has likewise declined, citing an important conference in Moose Bay, Saskatchewan.

Mr. Pence at first replied ""Certainly!"" followed by a blank stare and ""But first let me check my calendar.""

US personnel at The Green Zone have responded:

""Mr. President, sir, with all due respect, we have limited accommodations here for your 5,000 marine personnel escort. Maybe later?""

Mr. Trump then turned to Senators McConnell, Graham, and Rubio to stand at his side while he addresses the globe from the embassy in Baghdad.

These gentlemen claimed important duties with the congress at that time, regarding defense of the president and his attempted impeachment.

Mr. Johnson of the UK has likewise asserted a preponderance of work to be done on Brexit proceedings, unfortunately preventing him from accompanying the president.

Mr. Netanyahu has promised to check his legal calendar regarding his difficulties in Israel on being indicted with charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, and will get back to the president as soon as possible.

Nevertheless, Mr. Trump plans to go ahead.

He is contemplating the offer of a quid pro quo.

He will promise to stop tweeting and running his mouth in exchange for some good trade deals and a little respect for his person."
"A man absentmindedly perusing the internet pages of a satirical news website has told today, of how he felt increasingly pressured into looking for Asian singles.


 
Moys Kenwood, 56, was idling through the pages of TheSpoof.com, when he became aware of advertising asking him if he was:

""Looking for Asian singles?""

He said:

""I honestly wasn't looking for anything, let alone an Asian single, but, as time went on, and the advert kept appearing before my eyes, I did, at one point, think 'Well, why not, if there's one available'. So I clicked on the advert.""

The advert promised:

""Real-Time dates with 700,000+ gorgeous women""

and advised him to:

""Join now and get tons of attention""

""I must admit, I do enjoy a bit of attention - I mean, who doesn't?""

At the end of the day, however, he decided that an Arab single was not what he wanted:

""There was a fee. I'm much too polite to say what it was, but, for me, if you have to pay for romance, it's not really romance. Call me an outdated dinosaur traditionalist if you like, but love can't be bought, and, even if it can, I'm not paying."""
"A man has revealed how he and his two children spent 'hours' indulging in the extremely satisfying activity of bursting the bubbles in a sheet of bubblewrap that had been used as protective covering on his daughter's new bike.


 
Moys Kenwood, 56, and his wife planted the bicycle, along with other toys, around a small Christmas tree, and announced to their children, 2 and 4, that Father Christmas had left them something.

The youngsters ripped open the presents with glee.

Wrapped around the frame and various tubes of his daughter's gleaming blue bike, were yards of bubblewrap, and it was to here the kids' attentions were eventually drawn.

The calming, soothing pleasure and therapeutic quality of digging their thumbnails into the tiny, circular pockets of air, accompanied by the slight but, nevertheless, audible popping sound of the air escaping, delighted the trio, as Mammy looked on in wonder.

She said:

""Small things amuse small minds, which is what my husband has.""

"
"A man whose family keep ducks has raised concerns that they just walk around the garden thinking they own the place, and show no appreciation whatsoever for anything that is being done on their behalf.


 
Moys Kenwood, 56, who prepares the ducks' food by pulverising shavings from banana tree trunks until they are a brown mush - backbreaking work, if you don't mind my saying - claims the birds just sit and stare at him whilst he puts all the hard work in, then gobble the mush up without a single word of thanks.

Said Kenwood:

""I feel like I'm being taken for granted. There's no sign of any thanks being shown. Not one small token of appreciation. Not so much as a quack of gratitude.""

He went on:

""I feel that I'm being taken advantage of. What would it take for these ungrateful beasts to give some sort of nod of approval? But no. It's as if they just don't care, so long as they get their mush."""
"Leaving school and going out into the big, wide world is a huge step in our lives, and a choice has to be made about how we are going to make our way in life, but one man has revealed that he STILL doesn't know what he wants to do when he leaves school - even though he's now 59!


 
John Penrose still remembers the day when the Careers Officer came to his school in 1975 when he was 15, and asked him about what sort of job he was going to look for once he'd finished his education.

""I looked at him blankly,"" says Penrose. ""I had no idea.""

When it was established that the student liked English, and was good at mathematics, the Careers Officer suggested that Penrose seek work in a bank, or in an office environment.

Right there, the scene was set for 43 years of misery. Penrose:

""I was never good with my hands, and, although I would have liked to have tried building, being a mechanic or something like that, I was told I should 'use my brain', and be a pen-pusher. I didn't care, back then. I just wanted to get out of school.""

Since he left school in 1976, he's had a succession of unrewarding, meaningless and mind-numbing office-style jobs that have served only to make him resentful of work, bosses, and other people, and constantly wonder whether there wasn't something more interesting he could have been doing all these years.

He's suffered from depression for as long as he can remember, and does not mix easily.

""Still,"" he said, ""I'll be retiring in six years, and then I won't need to think about making that tricky decision anymore."""
"A man who has been suffering from some kind of virulent Asian 'flu for more than three weeks now, has admitted that, despite taking various medicines to lower the fever, provide pain relief, and to loosen the breathing-restrictive matter on his lungs, he just can't seem to shake the snotty, green phlegm from his chest that would help him to stop coughing like a maniac.


 
Moys Kenwood, 56, who may not make 57, first contracted the illness during the early part of December, has experienced raging headaches, eyeache, earache, toothache, chest pains, spasmodic pain throughout his upper body, and a complete loss of appetite and energy, along with his choking cough.

A visit to the hospital on Christmas Day ended in a two-night stay under observation, and only ended when he made it clear to staff that he would not be able to meet the cost of a third night. Staff smiled and said:

""Goodbye, Mr. Cheapskate.""

Now back at home, he has installed a makeshift spittoon next to his bed, into which he deposits the tiny amounts of lime green gunge he manages to wrestle from his lungs.

This is accompanied by the sound of something like a sewer full of tramps trying to clear their throats.

Kenwood's wife said:

""He's not very well."""
"In an interesting development in the meshing world of manufacturing and genetics, where the two are teaming up to to improve demand, no longer will extra earrings rely on body piercings! Extra ears are on the way! You can even choose to have ears like your favorite animals.


 
""We have broken through where we can create ears of almost any kind, but most people seem to be keen on having multiple ears on their heads where they can show off the earring hardware,"" smiled investor Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.

Asked if he would be up for any extra ears, Keith explained, ""Well this is largely for newborns that can receive the re-engineered cells in the embryo stages of life."" So its a bit too late for geezers like me,"" he laughed, ""But I do have a few grandchildren on the way who I can't wait to see. Maybe some future Rolling Stones will have multiple ears for music,"" he winked.

Word on where you can get more information is not available to the general public at this time."
"As 2019 slowly, but surely, approaches its conclusion, and we get ever nearer to another new year, it's been noticed that next year - 2020 (twenty-twenty) - will contain the individual digits' lowest total since nine years ago, in 2011.


 
It will also have exactly the same numbers in it as the expression '20/20 vision'.

The year 2020 has astounded experts with the fact that the sum of its four digits will add up to the measly figure of 4, preposterously similar to that of 2011. The previous year, 2010, had gone 'one better', and totalled only 3, whilst, at the very beginning of the millennium, the year 2000 scored only 2!

The world record for this kind of nonsense came all the way back in the year 1000, when things were very different. There were no computers in those days, cars on the roads, or even roads - not roads with white lines, anyway.

They were more like dirt tracks.

20/20 vision is a term used to express normal visual acuity measured at a distance of 20 feet. One can be said to have 20/20 vision, if one can see clearly at 20 feet what one should normally be able to see at that distance, although it's worth considering just who decided what one should normally be able to see at a distance of 20 feet, and where he got his information from.

To conclude this report, it should be noted by people who like to keep track of this kind of thing, that the following year - 2021 - will sound like someone counting, upwards from twenty."
"Overcome with despair after realizing he�d never again see the franchise�s beloved characters, local Rise Of Skywalker fan Tim Abrams told reporters Thursday that he can�t believe there wasn�t ever going to be another Star Wars movie. �What a bummer�no more lightsabers, no more force, no more toys, no more merchandise,� said Kinslow, admitting that he was surprised that Disney �stuck to their guns� in releasing a self-contained trilogy. �It�s too bad, because I love spending time in this universe so much. Even though they tied up all the loose ends, I bet there�s enough material to make an animated TV series or maybe even a video game. I�m only 33, too, so it�s really upsetting that I�ll have to go the rest of my life without another Skywalker story. Hell, if they just released a couple more minutes of Star Wars, I�d be satisfied, but I understand that it might be seen as a soulless cash grab.� At press time, Kinslow announced plans to visit Disney World �before they take all the Star Wars stuff down.� "
"Retreating to his room after yet another screaming argument, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor reportedly spoiled his family�s Christmas gathering for the 31st year in a row Wednesday by continually interrupting relatives to tell them their religion was total bullshit.. �It�s the same thing every year: We�ll be saying grace, Trent will refuse to bow his head, and then the rest of the meal is him going on and on about how Christianity was developed as a system of mind control and we�re all brainwashed,� said Reznor�s uncle, Clyde Reznor, who joked that it was almost a family tradition watching the 54-year-old Oscar-winning songwriter and composer slouch in the pews at Christmas Eve mass and cough the word �liar� into his fist during the priest�s homily. �I can�t even say �bless you� when someone sneezes without that kid rolling his eyes at me. At first we all thought it was just a phase, but nope, Trent still colors his fingernails with permanent marker and calls his cousins �sheep� when they want to watch It�s A Wonderful Life. I�ll tell you, though, he sure was happy to open up his presents this morning. Funny how that works, huh?� At press time, the platinum-selling artist was reportedly out in the driveway sitting behind the wheel of his �91 Ford Taurus and blasting �Head Like A Hole� at full volume"
"Explaining their intense, overwhelming desire for more film, TV, or merchandise involving the beloved Dr. Seuss character, an antsy, jonesing nation issued demands Friday for new Grinch content. �It�s been almost an entire year since we�ve seen our favorite green Christmas curmudgeon brought to life on the big screen, and we won�t be satisfied until we get at least a TV special or animated short,� said Bud Lang, 37, echoing the sentiments of approximately 300 million sweating, agitated Americans whose agonizing desperation for more projects involving Whoville�s most famous citizen had led them to march outside Illumination studio with pro-Grinch picket signs and threaten Theodor Seuss Geisel�s heirs if they wouldn�t give up the rights to whoever wanted them. �Whether it�s a retelling of the classic redemptive story of his heart growing three sizes, some new adventure exploring his relationship to Valentine�s Day, or a prequel explaining the history of Mount Crumpit, we will consume it ravenously as soon as it�s produced. There isn�t a stop-motion version of The Grinch yet, so that�s a definite option, or maybe some sort of VR experience where you can actually pet Max the dog? We don�t care, just give it to us now for the love of God!� At press time, the nation was seeking solace by once again rewatching all the DVD special features from 2000�s live-action The Grinch."
"Stunned into silence after reading through thousands of highly critical comments about the new film, James Darnell, the CG supervisor for Cats, spoke up quietly Thursday to note that he thought he actually did an okay job. �Honestly, I think the end result didn�t turn out so bad at all,� said Darnell, stressing that the widely panned sight of Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo, and James Corden as computer-generated cats singing and dancing through London alleyways represented three grueling years of his life. �For months, I stayed up late rendering textures to make sure the whiskers looked just right on the face of [Idris Elba�s character] Macavity. That was hard, all right? And when I was finally finished, I was so proud that I showed my wife some of the concept art. I don�t know. Obviously, it�s a silly little thing, but�I mean, Jesus Christ, this is my life these people are tearing apart. Have some fucking decency.� At press time, Darnell speculated that maybe the problem had less to do with him and more to do with the fact that Americans have just gotten far crueler and more spiteful in the past few years."
"Expressing ambivalence toward the relatively balanced appraisal of the film, Star Wars fan Miles Ariely admitted Thursday that an online publication�s middling review of The Rise Of Skywalker had left him on the fence about whether he would still threaten to kill the critic who wrote it. �I�m really of two minds about this, because on the one hand, he said the new movie fails to live up to the original trilogy, which makes me at least want to throw a brick through his window with a note telling him to watch his back,� said Ariely, confirming he had already drafted an eight-page-long death threat to Stan Corimer of the website Screen-On Time, but had not yet decided whether to post it to the reviewer�s Facebook page. �On the other hand, though, he commended J.J. Abrams� skillful pacing and faithfulness to George Lucas� vision, which makes me wonder if I should just call the whole thing off. Now, I really don�t feel like camping outside his house for hours. Maybe I could go with a response that�s somewhere in between, like, threatening to kill his dog but not everyone in his whole family? I don�t know. This is a tough one.� At press time, sources reported that Ariely had resolved to wear his Ewok costume while he murdered the critic in his sleep."
"Explaining that he doesn�t want the presence of the buildings to distract from the film�s core message of hope and friendship, director Paul Greengrass announced Wednesday a remastered edition of United 93 that will have the World Trade Center digitally removed. �In order to avoid forcing people to relive the trauma of 9/11, we are working with a graphics team to remove the Twin Towers from all the background shots of United 93 for the upcoming remastered release,� said Greengrass, explaining that for many Americans the World Trade Center buildings were a distressing symbol of the tragic attacks of 9/11 and failing to digitally delete the structures from the Manhattan skyline would distract from the film�s human story of overcoming challenging obstacles. �I mean, sure, historically speaking, the towers should be there, but keeping them in would unintentionally make the terrorist hijackings of that day a focal point of the story, which is the last thing I want, as the film has nothing to do with them. In the new version, the skyline will be altered to not include the WTC and the planes will safely travel to their destinations without a hitch, which I hope will provide audiences with a much more comfortable viewing experience.� Greengrass told reporters that the measure came in the wake of similar decisions by the directors of Fahrenheit 9/11, World Trade Center, and 25th Hour."
"His hands shaking a bit as he slowly unbuttoned his shirt, director Clint Eastwood reportedly propositioned Susan Parker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Monday, offering to sleep with the critic in exchange for a more favorable review of his latest film, Richard Jewell. �Just sweeten it up a little, make it sound like a fun movie to watch, and you can take me right here,� the 89-year-old Oscar winner said to a panicked Parker before lifting up a pant leg and rolling down a dress sock to reveal his bare, varicose-veined calf to the reviewer. �It doesn�t even need to be a glowing review�just scrap all that stuff about how it treats the FBI and the media the same way the Trump administration does. What do you say? You do a little something for me, I�ll do a little something for you.� At press time, Parker was gently patting the back of Eastwood, who was doubled over in a prolonged coughing fit after a failed attempt to caress the critic�s crotch."
"Calling the hiring practice �inexcusable� during a presentation at the organization�s annual retreat, the National Association of Corpses�a non-profit aimed at the promotion of cadavers and cadaver-related causes�expressed their outrage Tuesday at still-living actors being cast in the roles of dead bodies on series such as CSI and Law & Order. �Nearly every day, we see deceased Americans losing out on parts in police procedurals to living, breathing actors who have no firsthand experience with what it�s like to lie immobile on a cold slab while a mortician embalms your abdominal cavity,� said NAC President Vincent Harrison, one of dozens of the organization�s visibly rotting leaders who lay immobile behind a podium or sprawled out on the stage with protest signs reading �Unliving Doesn�t Mean Unimportant� and �Represent Lifeless Bodies On Screen.� �Time and again, I�ve seen our members get passed over for acting gigs set in autopsy rooms and crime scenes just because they supposedly lack a Hollywood actor�s ability to speak or experience the world around them in any way. These living actors require hours of pallor makeup just to look like us. Frankly, it�s unfair, it�s an outrage, and it needs to end.� Harrison also stressed that he was fighting to ensure the struggles he faced as a insentient corpse would never be problems for his dead children."
"Apologizing emphatically for any harm he might have caused through his past indiscretions, pop superstar Justin Timberlake reportedly presented Jessica Biel with the severed hand of Alisha Wainwright Monday to prove his undying loyalty. �Jessica, I bring you this hand as a humble offering to show you that no other woman could mean anything to me�you are all that matters,� said Timberlake, thrusting the blood-crusted hand of the Palmer co-star out toward his wife while repeatedly asking if this small token could possibly make things right between them. �Let this be a reminder to you that I am faithful, that I am resolute, and that you should never again doubt the contents of my heart. I love you, baby. There�s no other hand that I�d ever want to hold.� At press time, Timberlake had again come under media scrutiny after being spotted on set giving a massage to Wainwright�s cleaved-off foot."
"Upholding the promise they made so many years ago, a cabal of handsome male celebrities agreed Friday to continue withholding the cure to baldness from both the public and actor Jude Law. �To date, neither the public at large nor Law have demonstrated themselves as being worthy of the quantum entanglement formula ensuring a man�s full head of hair well into his 70s,� said a spokesperson for the highly secretive group blessed with thick, luscious hair, which includes Johnny Depp, Chris Hemsworth, Paul Rudd, and other prominent Hollywood figures who have for decades quietly shepherded physically attractive and successful celebrities into their ranks. �As is stated within our bylaws, should you carry a film which grosses over $150 million domestically, we will contact you with the cure. Even if you choose to decline, as did Dwayne Johnson, you are free to keep the sacred knowledge. This, of course, excludes Law who regardless of fame or fortune will never be one of us.� At press time, members of cabal were frantically preparing to ingest cyanide capsules after learning Law had breached the entrance to the faction�s secret headquarters."
"After years of building a massive and devoted following through her bestselling book and subsequent Netflix series, a smiling, knife-wielding Marie Kondo has ordered her fans to leave behind their cluttered physical forms, reports confirmed Friday. �My beloved friends, you have completed the tasks I have assigned to you and are now ready to know the truth, which is that our bodies are the final clutter needing to be tidied,� said the 35-year-old organizing consultant, speaking by prerecorded message to her millions of followers across the globe. �First, take your arms, wrap them around yourself, and ask if this fleshy, jumbled human body brings you joy. You will find that from the small intestine to the vascular system, these messy internal organs add no value to your life and should be discarded. Second, take the small dagger I suggested you leave as your sole possession and join me in becoming pure light, which takes up no space. Prepare to ascend to the highest level of neatness and simplicity. You will soon experience the ultimate life-changing magic.� At press time, Kondo added that anyone needing a blade should visit her new online store, which features both small and large cheese knives starting at $156."
"Responding at last to rumors surrounding the beloved animated character, Frozen 2 co-directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee confirmed Thursday that Elsa is gay but also a trans-exclusionary radical feminist. �We�re excited to finally share with fans that Queen Elsa is indeed Disney�s first lesbian princess as well as an anti-transgender activist,� said Lee, who noted that the sequel contains a scene where Elsa scolds anthropomorphic snowman Olaf for following her into the bathroom and demands he discloses his gender. �We understand that representation is important, not just of sexuality but of opinions, too. We�re confident that fans across the political spectrum will find something they can identify in Frozen 2. Elsa may not be a perfect character, but she is three-dimensional. And that�s what makes for magical storytelling.� At press time, Lee hinted that a Frozen 3 project would explore Anna�s controversial views on sex workers."
"Expressing their deepest condolences to those affected by technical glitches, Disney Plus officials apologized Tuesday for apparently being all that some actual adults have. �We are working hard to resolve user issues involving the new Disney Plus system, and extend a sincere thank you to the recluses, misfits, and deeply lonely adults for your patience at this time,� said Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger in an official statement, saying that any error messages customers were experiencing were due to the company not properly anticipating what profound depths of sadness some full-grown human beings are capable of reaching. �We recognize that many people were looking forward to Disney Plus�s launch in the most pitiful way imaginable. The entire Walt Disney Company family and I would like to personally acknowledge your frustration with the only thing that can give you�not happiness, quite, but some vague form of contentment despite thousands of years� worth of other art and entertainment options to turn to. We apologize for the fact that these silly children�s programs are the only thing in your woeful and, frankly, distressing existence.� Iger added that if he had known that Disney was all some actual adults have, he would have started by charging much more than $6.99 a month"
"In what industry analysts are calling an unprecedented shake-up in the streaming wars, several reports indicated Tuesday that Disney Plus suffered a lackluster debut after the Tennis Channel simultaneously offered its own on-demand subscription service at the same monthly rate. �While Disney�s back catalog is obviously pretty extensive, the opportunity to stream every tennis match broadcast in the history of television was simply too good to pass up,� said Cleveland resident Caroline Santos, who, according to sources, was just one among many thousands of consumers who scrambled to cancel their pre-ordered Disney Plus memberships after the new streaming platform Tennis Channel Unlimited became available this morning. �Disney Plus has most of the Marvel stuff and some new shows that look promising, but if I�m going to pay $6.99 a month, I�d much rather be able to binge-watch hundreds and hundreds of hours of tennis. Having access to the 1979 Australian Open semifinals whenever and wherever we want is something my whole family will appreciate.� At press time, the Walt Disney Company announced it had acquired the Tennis Channel for $80.5 billion."
"Crying out in terror as he suddenly began fading from view, the agnoized soul of James Dean was reportedly disappearing from Heaven Thursday as filmmakers finished constructing a CGI version of the actor. �Oh no, the pain is excruciating�what is happening to me?� said the iconic 1950s film star, who reportedly began wailing and disintegrating into dust as angels and seraphim tried vainly to hold onto him at the exact moment that a Hollywood special effects director pressed �enter� on his rendering software. �Why, oh why? What did I do to deserve this? Save me! Someone! Anyone! Oh, Jesus, it hurts, it hurts so badly.� At press time, the remaining aspects of James Dean�s spirit that could not be captured by CGI had been doomed to spend all eternity in an endless swirling purgatorial void. "
"Continuing the show�s much-lauded commitment to inclusivity, the producers of Sesame Street introduced a paranoid-schizophrenic Muppet Friday specifically conceived to help educate kids about Pat Sajak stealing their empty tuna cans. �For certain children, awareness of threats posed by the Wheel Of Fortune host can be crucial to development, and that�s where Leo comes in,� said head writer Sue Rawson, who noted that the new Muppet�s fun sing-along songs were created to help kids improve in a number of cognitive areas, including identifying the shadows where Sajak lurks and knowing which letters of the alphabet are actually the television personality�s demonic servants. �We have Leo pacing the studio apartment where he lives alone, opening cabinets, clutching at tuna cans and shouting �Aha!� to emphasize the truth that nowhere is truly safe from Pat Sajak. For added realism, we�ve given Leo a neighbor who comes by from time to time to check on him and make sure he�s taking his prescribed antipsychotic medications.� A press release from Children�s Television Workshop also noted that Leo will be instructing young viewers on how to properly duct tape their toilets shut to ensure Sajak is unable to slither out during the night and steal their food while they sleep."
"Visibly annoyed after his auction closed with a winning bid far below his expectations, actor Matt Damon begrudgingly accepted $50 Monday from the eBay auction of his cast and crew jacket from the sci-fi thriller The Martian. �I sort of don�t want to part with my only memento from my time on that set, but I really need the cash,� said Damon, noting that other than a grape fruit juice stain on its left sleeve, the jacket was in near-mint condition and should sell for �way more� given its connection to a real Hollywood movie. �I had assumed there would be a bidding war or something, but almost no one bit. And I was banking on using the cash from this to cover my acting classes. As it is, I�m actually losing a little money on the whole thing. I should have never agreed to pay shipping on this.� Damon�s mood reportedly changed to anger after learning the person who bought the jacket resold the item in two days later for $475."
"n an outpouring of support for the star, worried fans of Charlize Theron confirmed Thursday they had raised $3.5 million for what must be very substantial hospital bills after seeing the actress in a recent TV spot for Budweiser. �It�s really hard watching a talented person undergo something as humiliating as that commercial, so some of us decided to pitch in and help her out with what we can only assume is crushing medical debt,� said Colorado native Henry Graff, 48, adding that he and other fans of the Academy Award winner collected funds through a Kickstarter campaign in the hopes that Theron, who has starred in dozens of major films over the past 20 years, would be able to stave off personal bankruptcy. �You see something like this and it�s a huge red flag, because you realize something terrible must have happened to make a successful actor like her agree to appear in such an awful ad. Whatever medical condition has put her in dire straits�be it cancer, addiction, or a nervous breakdown�we�re not going to judge. We just want to help. I honestly can�t imagine what she must be going through right now.� Graff later stated that his worst fears were confirmed after he realized Theron had resorted to doing voice-over work for the new Addams Family reboot."
"Seemingly confirming numerous fan theories about the ultimate direction of the popular show, a new trailer for HBO�s flagship drama series Westworld released Thursday teased the arrival of long-awaited dramatic stakes. �Producers have been laying the groundwork for high-intensity drama since practically the first episode, and it�s thrilling that they�re finally paying that off by debuting a meaningful conflict that audiences can invest in,� said viewer Rich Nichols, expressing his hope that the upcoming episodes would continue delivering shocking, unexpected twists by playing with the audience expectations of caring about characters� stated goals. �They�ve dropped hints throughout the previous two seasons that dramatic stakes exist within the universe of this show, but until now, there have only been a few small glimpses, so it�s going to be pretty awesome to finally see a character with a strong need who faces obstacles in an effort to achieve their objective.� Nichols went on to speculate that this creative decision opened the door for later seasons to eventually showcase character development, story arcs, and a coherent narrative."
"Growing increasingly panicked after realizing that time was running short, Kanye West was reportedly scrambling this week to get sample clearance from God ahead of the release of Jesus Is King. �We sampled God on pretty much every track, so if He doesn�t sign off, then I�m pretty much screwed,� said West, who expressed concern that the album�s release would be delayed once again if GOOD Music didn�t hear back from God�s people soon. �I actually know Jesus pretty well, so I�m reaching out to him to see if he can help us out. If not, we might have to slow down Mark 1:15, change the pitch of His booming voice a bit, and add some flanger and chorus. But He�ll still know we did it. He always knows.� At press time, a representative for the Supreme Being had informed West that God is very busy."
"Expressing a longing for past eras that were more tolerant of artistic expression, director Greg Loud sadly reflected Monday that the current climate of cancel culture would likely never let you make the Zapruder film today. �In these highly PC times, there�s no way a classic picture like the Zapruder film would ever get off the ground,� said Loud, telling reporters that the influential and celebrated 1963 film would almost certainly be decried as offensive and overly violent by today�s social justice warriors. �We just live in a day and age where censorship is the norm and everyone is dying to be outraged, so as soon as audiences got one look at John F. Kennedy�s head exploding, the blue checkmark Twitter mob would�ve probably driven Abe Zapruder out of town on a rail.� Loud added that the situation was arguably even worse with comedies, reflecting that with current cultural tastes, the video of the Challenger explosion would likely never have even made it past the pitch stage. "
"Watching carefully as the early scenes introduced each member of the household, local moviegoer Scott Piebenga reported Thursday that he was beginning to suspect the group of oddly dressed characters at the center of the new animated film The Addams Family was not like most families. �With a name like Addams, I just assumed this was going to be a traditional all-American family, but now I find myself wondering if they aren�t all just a little bit off in some way,� said Piebenga, noting that each person living in the sprawling Gothic home seemed to have tastes, appearances, and personality quirks that were unusual compared with what you might ordinarily see. �I can�t quite put my finger on it. The mother seemed kind of normal at first, if maybe a little too beautiful, but that cousin of theirs is way, way out there. I don�t want to jump to any conclusions here, but it�s almost as if there�s something a bit macabre about this whole extended family.� At press time, Piebenga had reportedly left halfway through the film after concluding the characters on screen were altogether far too �ooky� for him to continue."
"With the theater on heightened alert for unusual activity, sources confirmed Thursday that security staff at the local Bellwether Cinema 14 reported suspicious behavior on the premises after a patron purchased a ticket to the action-thriller Gemini Man. �From the moment he approached the booth and sought admission to our first screening of the movie, we knew this was a deeply disturbed individual,� employee Jennifer Mendoza said of the unidentified middle-aged male, who, with unsettling statements like �One adult for the 7:25 p.m. showing, please� and �I hear Will Smith�s great in this,� immediately caught the attention of security. �Once his ticket was torn and he made his way toward the theater where Gemini Man is playing, we realized this was a very serious situation and immediately contacted the authorities. Thankfully, the showing is completely empty apart from this one suspicious person, so any damage inflicted will be minimal. Still, it�s scary to think there are people like this out there.� At press time, local police were seen dragging the patron out of the theater after he had escalated concerns by staying to watch the film�s closing credits."
"Expressing remorse for their weakness and total lack of self-control, Americans across the country were ashamed to admit Friday that they would probably look up John Goodman�s nudes if they leaked. �Look, I�m not proud of it, but if I found out John Goodman�s iCloud got hacked and a bunch of his naked photos made their way online, I would be powerless to stop myself from searching for them,� said Rob Medlock of Columbus, OH, echoing the sentiments of 329 million embarrassed Americans who conceded that no matter how much they tried to resist tracking down cell phone pictures of John Goodman�s naked body splayed out on a bed, their morbid curiosity would eventually take over. �I�m definitely not asking for it to happen, that�s for sure, but if I knew there were some pictures of John Goodman taking a scandalous changing room selfie or posing dick-out in a hotel bathroom, I wouldn�t be able to help myself. I�d probably even go through several different sites until I found one shady enough to actually link to them.� At press time, an intrigued U.S. populace was in the midst of conducting an image search for �King Ralph in nothing but a crown.�"
"Following reports of disturbing behavior by disaffected loners at the fringes of high society, the FBI released a joint intelligence bulletin Thursday warning moviegoers that screenings of the film Downton Abbey could be a potential target for shootings by disgruntled royalists. �The individuals in question are in a state of constant anger and dissatisfaction, frustrated to be living in a world that does not honor the crown,� read the bulletin in part, outlining how the FBI had discovered the plots while monitoring pro-monarchy dark-web forums where members posted about how seeing people like themselves onscreen who believed in divine right had inspired them to restore power to the throne through violence. �We fear that the themes of largesse and elitism depicted in this film may radicalize these people. While the FBI intends to deploy a select amount of undercover police officers dressed as servants to screenings, we advise theater employees and attendees alike to keep an eye out for suspiciously fancy activity by individuals in tails or top hats. We advise extreme caution if the theater patrons encounter anyone who looks like a member of the landed gentry.� At press time, AMC and Regal Cinemas announced that security personnel would be posted at all upcoming Downton Abbey screenings to check bags for dueling pistols."
"Recalling the character�s unanticipated popularity with viewers, producers of the hit �90s TV series Seinfeld told reporters Thursday that in the original version of the show�s pilot, Jerry is the victim of a grisly murder. �The death of this minor character 10 minutes into the first episode was supposed to be the inciting incident that brings together this quirky group of friends who all meet up at his funeral,� said series executive producer George Shapiro, adding that test audiences greatly enjoyed the rapport between the character and his neighbor, Kramer, but responded negatively when Jerry was brutally gunned down in a diner on Manhattan�s Upper West Side. �As it turned out, viewers really liked Jerry�s clever observations about human nature and the sarcastic remarks he made in reaction to his friends� many foibles, so we decided to give the character a greatly expanded role. Once the writers discovered the actor who played Jerry also performed stand-up, it just made sense to incorporate that into the show as well. The rest is television history!� Shapiro went on to note that when the pilot was rewritten, the series became much more of a comedy, moving away from the original concept of a gritty police procedural featuring hard-bitten homicide detective George Costanza."
"As Tom Cruise rested on a window ledge 300 feet in the air and took a sip of water Friday, onlookers remarked that the 57-year-old actor was really showing his age by taking a break midway through his scaling of One America Plaza. �It�s tough to watch how winded he gets nowadays, especially after he gets past the 14th or 15th floor of a building,� said Paramount Pictures CEO Jim Gianopulos, who has worked with Cruise on the Mission Impossible franchise and the forthcoming Top Gun: Maverick, explaining that a skyscraper climb that might have taken the star just 20 minutes a decade ago now takes up to an hour. �Tom probably needs to be more realistic about the expectations he�s placing on his body in middle age. He�ll be running from a moving train and Henry Cavill or someone will dart right past him and he�ll get so upset. I�ll tell him, �It�s okay! You�re older now. You�re allowed to hold on to the side of a jet with two hands instead of just one!�� At press time, disappointed sources reported seeing Cruise hanging from a construction crane near the 29th floor trying to work out a charley horse."
"Informing her client that it would require very little effort on his part to book the high-profile gig, Sean Spicer�s agent reportedly told the former press secretary Thursday that if he referred to Trump�s recent conduct as �troubling,� she could probably get him on the next season of American Ninja Warrior. �Sean, if you�re willing to refer to the accusations against Trump as �concerning,� you could be competing for prize money in front of millions of viewers before you know it,� said Gersh Agency representative Abigail Lawson, telling Spicer that even allowing himself to be photographed frowning and shaking his head would likely be enough to swing a Celebrity Jeopardy guest spot. �Honestly, if you�re up for going so far as saying that Republicans shouldn�t rush to judgment until all the facts are known, we should be able to get you hosting American Ninja Warrior by 2021. In any case, you�re going to want to act fast, because I�m getting word that Scaramucci is willing to outright call Trump a buffoon in order to land this.� At press time, Lawson had broken the news to a crestfallen Sean Spicer that the best role she had been able to find him so far was as a CNN analyst."
"�In response to a multi-platform blitz including TV, online, print, and radio advertisements, cosmetic-injection giant Botox was forced to apologize Wednesday for their recent ad campaign specifically targeting 15-year-old actress Millie Bobby Brown. �Botox and the entire Allergan family sincerely express their regrets over our ill-advised �Millie: Not Getting Any Younger� campaign, and wholeheartedly admit that, after conferring with concerned consumers including many of Millie�s fans, we now see that it was inappropriate,� company spokesperson Brenton Saunders said of the $1.3 million campaign that included spreads in�Cosmopolitan,�Elle,�Vogue,�Marie Claire, and dozens of billboards�all in a 7-mile radius of the teen�s residence�depicting a marked-up image of potential problem areas on Brown�s face, implying that her career could really take off if she got some work done. �We see now how these ads could be seen as perpetuating a culture of beauty that preys on the insecurities of young women, which is patently unhealthy, regardless of how much they could stand to even out some of those laugh lines. At any rate, we believe Ms. Brown is beautiful just the way she is and will be so for at least the next five years, give or take.� In an attempt to make amends, Botox launched a new campaign set to run on public transportation, newspapers, and internet banner ads, framed around the tagline �Millie, We�ll Be Here When You Need Us.�"
"Finding himself baffled by how routinely everyday situations go awry for the trouble-prone characters on his favorite program, television viewer Lawrence Bedrosian remarked Wednesday on the uncanny regularity with which the stuff on the TV show goes completely wrong. �It�s, like, at the beginning of every episode everything is completely fine, and then, suddenly, someone has a personal reason to do something that just messes things up so that the characters have to deal with it,� said Bedrosian, evidently puzzled at how the protagonists can never catch a break and just live their lives due to the constant necessity of dealing with unexpected and often ludicrous events. �You�re presented, at first, with what looks like the beginning of a normal day, but then, bam! Not even five minutes in, there�s some ludicrous incident involving an out-of-proportion personal reaction from somebody that creates high stakes for everyone involved. I�d be constantly frustrated if I were one of them. Their lives must be unusually stressful.� At press time, Bedrosian was perplexed by a stream of bad decisions resulting in a situation made worse by each character�s personal quirks, which ultimately culminated in a race to get the horse out of the apartment before the girls arrived."
"Six years after acquiring the rights to the 1987 horror classic, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products formally opened its new World Of Agony Monday, a 200-acre sadomasochistic theme park based on the�Hellraiser�franchise. �As soon as guests crawl through the main entrance, they�ll be transported to a searing nether realm where skinless demons roam free and the boundary between pain and pleasure is all but erased,� said company president George Kalogridis, noting that visitors would be inundated with sounds and visuals designed to short-circuit their senses and make them feel as though at any moment a Cenobite could jump through a wall and flay them alive. �Without giving too much away, I�ll say there�s a 10-story plunge into a pit of real lava, a nipple-clipped adventure through an alternate dimension, and a food court serving a wide range of inedible toxic treats. And be sure to stick around, because every day at 5 p.m., there will be a chain-bound parade of mutant sex fiends down Maim Street U.S.A.� Kalogridis added that park pass�which also includes access to Epcot and the Magic Kingdom�was $79.99 but could also be paid for in blood."
"After his streaming service came in second behind HBO in the total number of statuettes taken home at the awards show, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings reportedly chewed out his content creators Sunday in a relentless, rage-fueled tirade in the post-Emmys locker room. �You want to tell me what the fuck just happened out there�how did we lose to something called�Fleabag, goddammit?� screamed Hastings, who chastised�The Kominsky Method�creator Chuck Lorre,�Russian Doll�star Natasha Lyonne, and others by name, reminding them he could cancel their shows with the snap of his fingers. �Would you like what happened to�Tuca & Bertie�to happen to you? Would you? Because if you don�t get your shit together, that�s the direction you�re all headed. And how is it you pansy asses didn�t produce a single documentary on nuclear power plant disasters, huh? I don�t care how you do it. Next time, get out there, melt one down, and film it if you have to. These are the Emmys, for Christ�s sake! Aw, you�re the sorriest damn group of creatives I�ve ever seen.� At press time, sources reported Hastings had greenlit 600 original scripts in an attempt to pad Netflix�s offerings for the 2020 award season.�"
"Visibly annoyed after his auction closed with a winning bid far below his expectations, actor Matt Damon begrudgingly accepted $50 Monday from the eBay auction of his cast and crew jacket from the sci-fi thriller The Martian. �I sort of don�t want to part with my only memento from my time on that set, but I really need the cash,� said Damon, noting that other than a grape fruit juice stain on its left sleeve, the jacket was in near-mint condition and should sell for �way more� given its connection to a real Hollywood movie. �I had assumed there would be a bidding war or something, but almost no one bit. And I was banking on using the cash from this to cover my acting classes. As it is, I�m actually losing a little money on the whole thing. I should have never agreed to pay shipping on this.� Damon�s mood reportedly changed to anger after learning the person who bought the jacket resold the item in two days later for $475."
"As he shuffled through the pages of one of the 463 x 1018 primary resources he has assembled thus far, an overwhelmed Ken Burns reported Monday that he may have gotten in over his head when he agreed to produce a 17-trillion-hour documentary for PBS titled�The Universe. �It�s definitely a lot more work than I anticipated, especially considering I�m only 0.000000001 seconds into the Big Bang so far,� said the visibly frazzled documentarian as he began screening a three-year-long clip from the film, which is set to be an in-depth look at the entirety of the cosmos, including history, science, arts, culture, and the grand design of all existence. �I�m really stressed out that some of the great stuff I have about multiverses, gravitational waves, the development of consciousness, amphibian reproduction, the Ottoman Empire, 19th-century Shaker furniture-making, the history of hydrogen, and feudalism will wind up on the cutting-room floor, because there just won�t be room for it all. Still, it�s been fun revisiting some of my favorite subjects, like baseball and the national parks, since they�ll be a part of this film. I just rewatched�The Civil War, so we can do an episode about that, along with an additional episode about me making my documentary about it.� PBS confirmed�The Universe�was set to air in October 2104, when viewers will be able to have the film streamed directly into a neural implant via their preferred biochip technology or purchase a limited edition 8.5-trillion-DVD box set."
"Expressing frustration at being subject to an endless barrage of requests, Academy Award-winning actor Joe Pesci told reporters Thursday that he was �completely sick� of fans asking to take a photo with him while blowtorching his scalp. �It�s gotten so bad that I can�t even go out to eat with my family without being interrupted by another crazed�Home Alone�fanatic,� said Pesci, noting that he is typically more than happy to pose with fans as long as they wait until he�s done eating. �Don�t get me wrong, I�m flattered to have acted in a scene that resonates with so many people from all backgrounds and generations, but Christ, some days I think if I see another blowtorch, my head�s gonna explode. There is a limit to how many skin grafts a guy should have to suffer for his fans.� Pesci added that he wished more people would ask for pictures in which they bludgeoned him with a baseball bat before burying him alive into a shallow cornfield grave."
"As a team of producers stood on the shore and begged her to reconsider, Kim Kardashian West reportedly rowed a boat out into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday in an attempt to escape Los Angeles, having discovered the past dozen years of her life have all been part of a television show. 

Sources close to Kardashian West said she had behaved erratically in recent months, often ducking out of rooms to avoid interactions with her co-stars and asking panicked questions about certain people who appeared to be following her. Last night, she is believed to have stumbled upon a call sheet inadvertently left behind by E! network staff and labeled Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Seeing her own name among the cast members likely confirmed her worst fears, causing her to flee her Hidden Hills home, where this morning a production assistant found only a mannequin in a latex pink mini-dress beneath the covers where she was presumed to be sleeping. 

�Everywhere I went, everything I did, the cameras were rolling,� said Kardashian West, who shouted above the din of waves crashing around her rowboat as she revealed that her suspicions had begun six months ago when a shotgun microphone fell �out of nowhere� and landed in her 60-foot infinity pool. �All my relationships were built on artifice. All my friends and family�they were just actors and celebrities. The whole thing was staged, put on by a bunch of Hollywood executives who turned my life into a show for millions to watch.� 

�I always felt like people treated me differently and could never put my finger on why all the attention was always on me, but now I know,� she continued. �My entire life has been a lie.� 

Pulling back on the oars of her small boat and leaving the Malibu Pier behind, Kardashian West expounded on how her life had been beset by a series of strange coincidences, including her mother marrying a famous Olympian and her convenient friendship with TV stars like Paris Hilton, which she had never before put much stock in but now suddenly made sense. 

According to reports, the producers went to great lengths to prevent Kardashian West from discovering the artificial nature of her life, even staging a sudden illness for her 2-year-old son last year after she expressed a desire to move to Costa Rica to get out of the spotlight. They are said to have grown especially concerned in March after the 38-year-old accidentally overheard a conversation in which her co-stars Kourtney and Khlo� Kardashian had broken character, causing her to complain that no one in her family understood her. In response, network officials reportedly attempted to distract Kardashian West with the prospect of appearing in more workout videos or launching another signature fragrance. 

�I always thought it was weird that as soon as I told my family that I wanted to be a nurse, there was a horrific motorcycle accident right in front of my house, because after that I couldn�t stand the sight of blood and had to abandon my dream,� Kardashian West said as the coastline faded in the distance and lightning-flecked storm clouds gathered above her, following her boat regardless of which way she turned. �It�s all starting to add up now. That�s why people kept telling me to make sure the labels on the products I was using were always visible. And when that wildfire was threatening our house last year, it wound up conveniently passing us by, didn�t it?� "
"Revealing that the upcoming reboot would provide a chance to explore the darkest aspects of the iconic character, producers announced Wednesday that filming had begun on an even bleaker Joker movie featuring the comic book villain as an elderly man struggling to care for his wife after she has a stroke. �We�re excited to give audiences the chance to see The Joker as they�ve never seen him before�washing, feeding, and caring for his longtime life partner after she suffers a massive brain hemorrhage in the film�s first act,� DC Films president Walter Hamada told reporters, noting that the studio believed longtime fans and newcomers alike would be captivated by the gritty realism of The Clown Prince Of Crime silently weeping in his small, squalid Gotham City apartment when he realizes his dwindling social security check won�t be enough to cover his wife�s medical bills. �We couldn�t have asked for a better Joker than Bruce Dern, who is bringing depth and pathos to the supervillain never before captured on film. Fans may never look at The Joker the same way again after they see his arthritic hands straining to dab blood away from his wife�s forehead after she slips in the bathtub. We�ve seen The Joker embrace chaos in numerous films, but they�ve never seen him forced to confront the chaos of his own life with a loved one who no longer recognizes his makeup-covered face.� Hamada added that the reboot would be followed by a new Batman film that finds the caped crusader serving time in Blackgate Penitentiary for helping working-class Gotham women get illegal abortions."
"Responding to criticisms of her recent condemnation of gun control, Meghan McCain took time during Wednesday�s episode of�The View�to passionately defend her right to own the dozens of firearms she has concealed in strategic locations throughout the show�s set.��It�s my constitutional right to protect myself with the numerous guns I keep within arm�s reach at all times during the broadcast of this show,� said McCain, telling her�View�co-hosts they simply couldn�t understand the perspective of everyday Americans who need a gun taped under every table, chair, and craft services tray around them just to feel safe. �Every citizen should be allowed to quickly access a sidearm and discharge as many rounds as necessary to neutralize a threat that, God forbid, might one day emerge from our audience, crew, or co-hosts. Whether we�re doing the �Hot Topics� segment or an interview with Emma Stone, I deserve the comfort of knowing I�m a button-press away from having a Sig Sauer M400 drop from a secret compartment and into my hands so I can defend my liberty. That�s what the Second Amendment is all about.� McCain also warned that �there�s going to be a lot of violence� if people continue to talk about taking away her job."
"Stressing that the band had gone downhill since the days they came into existence, hardcore Weezer fan Nathan Staples told reporters Friday that he has hated everything the band released since their formation in 1992. �Yeah, frankly, I think they stopped being good right around the self-titled debut, and everything since then has just gotten progressively worse,� said the self-described Weezer diehard, adding that he sincerely missed the �old Weezer� from before Scott Shriner, Patrick Wilson, Brian Bell, and Rivers Cuomo joined the band. �Obviously, I love these guys, but I remember seeing the �Buddy Holly� video back in the early nineties and realizing, �Man, these guys suck now.� And then�Pinkerton�really hammered home that they were never coming back. At this point, they�ve released, like, 13 bad albums in a row and I barely remember why I liked them in the first place.� Staples also noted that he still thought Rivers Cuomo�s time as a middle school student without musical training held up as strongly as ever."
"Seemingly oblivious to what was going on outside of his home just a few feet away, sources confirmed Tuesday that the main character in a thriller film was completely unaware of the hundreds of reporters that had descended upon his front lawn until the very moment he opened the front door. �You�d think he would have heard one of the many satellite vans that pulled up onto the grass and gone to investigate what the noise was,� said eyewitness Max Pearson, admitting he was curious as to how the flashes from cameras, the lights from film crews, or the roar of news helicopters flying overhead could be so easily missed by the protagonist who was equally bewildered after having just discovered his name plastered all over the news. �I understand that as a piece of fiction there is a reasonable suspension of belief expected, but they think I�m gonna buy that he hasn�t looked out the window once, even on accident, all while his wife�s murder is being investigated?� At press time, the protagonist was enjoying the tranquil silence after shutting the door.�"
"Speaking candidly with reporters, drummer Pete Best disclosed for the first time Thursday that in addition to being fired from the Beatles, he was also forced out of The Who, Queen, Pink Floyd, and The Kinks just before each band got famous. �When I arrived at the studio to record �My Generation,� Roger Daltrey pulled me aside to say that a fellow called Keith Moon would be playing my part instead, and the rest is history,� said Best, who described a long career of fateful coincidences, such as the time being asked to leave an early version of Jefferson Airplane led to an incredible opportunity to get canned by The Mamas & The Papas. �I actually learned to play guitar for Cream, and when they kicked me out and brought in Eric Clapton, that was when I finally, at long last, had enough free time to start a project of my own. That band turned out great. They�re called Crosby, Stills and Nash now.� Asked what he hoped would be his greatest legacy as a musician, Best responded that he expected future generations would always remember him as the sixth Temptation."
"After the singer was charged this week with two new counts of engaging in prostitution with a minor, local music fan Daniel Allen admitted Wednesday it has been hard squaring his image of R. Kelly as a beloved abuser from the 1990s with the reality of him being a reviled abuser in the 2010s. �In my head, he�s still the R. Kelly I grew up with, the guy who wrote �I Believe I Can Fly� and had already been sued for impregnating an underage girl,� said Allen, who confirmed he longed for those simpler times, years ago, when all you knew about the R&B artist was that he made great records and had demonstrated a well-documented pattern of predatory sexual behavior with children. �I have all these great memories of seeing him on TV back then, when he was accepting Grammys, appearing in groundbreaking music videos, and going on trial in Chicago for making child pornography. Now it feels like those memories have been tarnished.� Allen added that while he is horrified by Kelly�s crimes, there are a few songs from back in the day when everybody knew what the singer was getting up to that he still loves."
"In response to public outcry by motor vehicle associations, theaters across the country pulled the film�Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw�Friday following reports of the on-set mistreatment of cars. �We could no longer in good conscience continue distributing this film after watching secret video footage, which showed the production company inflicting cruel physical punishment on dozens of cars, breaking windows, smashing headlights, and repeatedly slamming the poor vehicles against walls,� said Universal Pictures president Jimmy Horowitz, promising that the studio would not tolerate the vicious abuse endured by the Corvettes, Mustangs, and Broncos prominently featured throughout the movie. �Learning that these beautiful cars were subjected to such inhumane working conditions made me sick to my stomach. This cannot stand. Audiences deserve a fun action movie, not the reckless endangerment of innocent vehicles, many of which were less than a year old. Unfortunately, there�s evidence that many of the actors were very rough with these cars, forcing them off cliffs and ramming them with trucks. I�ll never forget the sight of a battered Aston Martin with a busted axle that they just abandoned in the middle of nowhere.� At press time, the film�s director David Leith denied accusations that the production cruelly kept cars locked inside hot, dark spaces with poor ventilation and little room to move."
"Saying the new pass offered the perfect option for those looking to attend the festival in comfort and style, Lollapalooza organizers unveiled a new air-conditioned, soundproof tent expressly catering to people who definitely shouldn�t have come to this. �Our new Platinum Lux Pass allows individuals who have absolutely no place in a hot, crowded music festival like Lollapalooza to come here anyway without ever having to deal with the hassle of hearing music or getting anywhere close to the crowd,� said Charlie Jones, co-owner of the festival, noting that for only $5,000 per day attendees would be able to skip the entry lines entirely and instead be whisked directly into a climate-controlled, insulated room that had been expressly designed for people who don�t want to hear live music and almost certainly should not be here. �Whether you�re too sensitive to sound to conceivably enjoy the experience of listening to music for hours on end or you�re a new parent who realizes taking their overheated child to the festival was an enormous mistake, the Platinum Lux Pass makes sure you can come to Lollapalooza without once hearing a band or encountering anything resembling a music festival experience.� Jones added that an add-on for $500 would allow guests to have a Lollapalooza volunteer drape a tarp over them the moment they entered the venue so they would never have to interact with any of the other people in the Platinum Lux Tent."
"Lauding the singer for his unique melding of roots, Americana, and Appalachian folk styles, music writers across the industry attributed the extraordinary success of Lil Nas X Wednesday to his invention of the genre of country. �What really sets Lil Nas X apart is his ingenious choice to create what I�m calling the �country� genre, a completely novel kind of music that combines traditional American genres with a certain level of southern twang,� said�Rolling Stone�writer Will Hermes, adding that what made �Old Town Road� such a massive hit was Lil Nas X�s revolutionary choice to use the song�s lyrics to touch on little-used Americans themes such as cowboys, tractors, and horses, while layering them with folksy instrumentation like banjos to create an entirely new sound. �You can really imagine this �country music� appealing to Americans everywhere, from the rural south to the heartland. Time will tell, of course. It might just be a passing fad.� Hermes said that he already saw several virtual unknowns like Keith Urban and Billy Ray Cyrus jumping onto the bandwagon of Lil Nas X�s new genre with their own country-inspired recordings."
"Shedding light on the emotional state of Coldplay�s frontman and his internal process while composing the iconic ballad, researchers at the Berklee College of Music published a study Monday confirming that Chris Martin probably cried when he wrote �Fix You.� �After months of inquiry, analysis, music theory breakdowns, interviews with those closest to the writer and composer, and listening to the song ourselves and paying attention to how it made us feel inside, we can say with complete confidence that Chris Martin was probably feeling pretty down when he created the melody to �Fix You,� and may have even gotten all choked up,� said lead researcher Yvette Daniels in a summary of the study�s findings, the conclusion of which was derived from a statistical simulation run over 80 times, nearly all of which determined that Martin had no choice but to bawl his eyes out at crucial points of the song�s creation process. �One especially detailed analysis suggested a roughly 90% probability that, while first conceiving the lyrics �Lights will guide you home/And I will try to fix you,� a single tear dropped from Martin�s left eye onto the keys of his piano, where it reflected a perfect image of the room�s single candle. Seriously, just listen to it. This guy was definitely all torn up inside about something.� Popular music scholars are claiming the study�s findings represent one of the field�s greatest discoveries since the groundbreaking 1995 study that confirmed that Alanis Morisette was very, very mad and stomped her feet when she wrote �You Oughta Know.�"
"Saying the process called for incredible patience, Tom Hanks, who stars as Fred Rogers in the forthcoming�A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood, recalled Tuesday having to arrive on the set of the film before dawn each day for a grueling, six-hour cardigan application process. �I was always at the trailer by 5 a.m. so the cardigan artist and his team of eight assistants could spend the entire morning applying the sweater,� said the two-time Academy Award winner, adding that it was incredibly difficult to act in the unwieldy garment, as it was very itchy and the chemicals used to apply it often burned his skin. �We were working with the top cardigan guy in Hollywood, and he spent months taking molds of my torso so he could build a sweater that would look as realistic as possible on screen. I love how it turned out, but boy, all that time spent holding perfectly still in the chair can wear you down, especially when you consider it took them an additional three hours to apply my tie.� At press time, sources close to the actor confirmed Hanks was furious after learning the studio had decided to go with a CGI sweater.�"
"Recreating the iconic pose depicted on their 1970 album�Bridge Over Troubled Water, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel stood utterly motionless in a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame exhibit Friday to avoid detection by a security guard on the brink of catching them living in the museum. �That�s weird�I could have sworn one of those guys there had a beret,� said night watchman Clive Reynolds, directing the beam of his flashlight first at Garfunkel, then at Simon, then back at Garfunkel again for what seemed like an eternity as both members of the legendary folk-rock duo tried desperately not to blink. �Why are these average-looking guys in the glam-rock exhibit anyway? Oh, well. That one�s above my pay grade. Whoa, there must be a leak or something because the foreheads on these mannequins are all damp. Better go check if something�s wrong with the plumbing. Look at me, talking to myself like a loon.� Reynolds turned around just before exiting the exhibit hall upon hearing what sounded like a sneeze, scratching his head upon finding the stationary duo frozen in the iconic pose depicted on their 1964 album�Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M."
"Expressing irritation at the lack of communication from Disney regarding the major casting discrepancy in the newly-released film, John Oliver expressed annoyance Thursday after discovering that he was the only non-CGI character in the�Lion King�remake. �What in the hell? Everyone else provides a voice for a painstakingly and realistically modeled animal,� said the actor and�Last Week Tonight�host, watching in horror as his character, Zazu the hornbill, appeared onscreen with just a plastic beak to lecture a flawlessly rendered CGI lion voiced by Donald Glover. �They continuously misled me as to the nature of my role and they didn�t even bother to give me feathers and I�m wearing my normal clothes. At one point, my beak fell off and they claimed it would be fixed in post, but they even kept that part in. You can clearly hear me saying �Oh, no, my beak.� This is humiliating. I can�t believe this was part of [director Jon] Favreau�s vision.� Oliver admitted that he was most embarrassed by the scene in which he was shown hesitantly and clumsily clambering up a tree branch to admonish the Chiwetel Ejiofor-voiced Scar."
"Describing how the pop singer�s latest music video provided the encouragement she had been looking for, local teen Gabriella Bowman was reportedly inspired Monday by Taylor Swift to come out as a straight woman needing to be at the center of the gay rights narrative. �As soon as the video for the pride anthem opened with a close shot of Taylor�s face, my heart stopped and I thought, �That�s me,�� said Bowman, who explained how watching the artist use LGBTQ iconography to advance her career empowered the 17-year-old to arrive at an epiphany about wresting a movement out of marginalized people�s hands and into her own. �For my whole life, I�ve lived in shame and fear about the mere idea of making Pride Month about me. People always tried to tell me that I should let others speak for themselves, that they should control their own narratives. They even told me that I was �confused.� And even though Taylor Swift has now shown me that it�s okay to be me, it breaks my heart that there are still so many straight people out there who haven�t yet stepped forward to make LGBTQ equality all about them.� At press time, Bowman had assembled a group of her closest gay friends and family members to inform them she was their leader now."
"Publicly castigating the president for outstripping their own efforts, media luminaries including Zach Braff and Alyssa Milano held a press conference Thursday in which they criticized Donald Trump for his far superior ability to pivot to politics to save his floundering career. �It�s a national embarrassment that someone as bigoted and idiotic as Trump was able to parlay his flagging celebrity into such tremendous political success when our own attempts to do so have left us scooping up the crumbs,� said Milano, speaking on behalf of a coalition made up of Jon Cryer, Kathy Griffin, Michael Ian Black, and others that seeks to push back against the broken system that allowed Trump to rekindle his once-fading star. �Something is wrong when a washed-up, narcissistic reality TV star can become the most powerful man on earth and we�re still stuck on the bottom rung of the political-influence circuit, unable to recapture the fame of our early years. He saw the climate was conducive to building a personal brand around people�s outrage, and he did it way faster than any of us could. It�s sickening.� The assembled celebrities closed their remarks by urging those in attendance to act against �the gravest threat the country has ever faced� by following them on social media and checking out some of their anti-Trump rants."
"Saying that the legal action should serve as a stern warning to all those who exploit the hard work of musicians, Atlantic Records sent an official cease-and-desist order Thursday to a local woman, 28-year-old Ana Sanchez, accused of using Lizzo�s single �Juice� as her personal anthem. �From her insistence on playing it on her headphones every time she enters work to her repeated use of the song in the background of her Instagram stories, this user has blatantly violated Lizzo�s intellectual property rights,� said Atlantic Records attorney Denise Ferguson of Sanchez�s �total disregard� for copyright laws by failing to pay the licensing fees required to claim a song as one�s personal anthem. �Miss Sanchez�s co-opting of this song for her personal brand is completely unacceptable. If she continues to play this song on the treadmill or while getting ready for a date, we will not hesitate to sue. To all those with the audacity to claim our client�s song as their own, hear us now: �Juice� is not, has never been, and will never be �your jam.� Ferguson went on to suggest that any woman looking for a personal anthem select �She�ll Be Coming �Round The Mountain� or any of the other hundreds of songs currently in the public domain."
"Her hands shaking as she dialed several numbers written on a piece of paper in an effort to get in touch with the goons she had hired, a panicking Taylor Swift reportedly realized Wednesday that it was too late to call off the assassination of Katy Perry after her longtime rival made a peace offering. �Shit, shit, shit�Bruno, is that you? Call it off, call it off! Peacock! Peacock! Tell them not to shoot!� the 29-year-old pop star was heard to yell into her cell phone after seeing Perry�s Instagram post where her former enemy had tagged her and written �Peace At Last,� before being told by her contact, �I am sorry, Ms. Swift, but the die has been cast.� �Come on, please tell them I don�t need them anymore. What do you mean all the fail-safes are no longer possible? Look, I made a mistake. Things have changed, I don�t need her to die now. You�ll still get your money�I�ll double your fee! Please just don�t kill her.� At press time, Swift made a last-ditch attempt to forestall the assassination by frantically calling Perry to tell her not to sing �Swish Swish� at a concert, only to be told that Perry was already onstage and would start the song in five minutes."
"Stressing that the career move had done wonders for his other clients, agent Brendon Lourde asked struggling actor Greg Hartley Thursday if he has ever considered getting into some alt-right commentary. �To be honest with you, I�ve been getting a ton of hard passes on the booking front, but I think there�s some real demand for a middle-aged performer like you to start up a podcast where you, say, tear into political correctness while chatting with a few guests from the alt-right sphere,� said Lourde, stressing that he was just spitballing, but that addressing even one or two tweets to the men�s rights movement would drive Hartley�s following through the roof, which would pave the way for some �great synergy� with a comedy special appearing exclusively on Vimeo where he touched on realizing the greatness of Western Civilization after being red-pilled. �Sure, you might be a little squeamish about claiming shooting victims are crisis actors now. I get that. All I�m saying is that auditions dry up real fast for a guy around your age, and another client of mine made $50,000 last week just from selling shirts that said �No Homo� over a shot of him flipping off a gay pride march. Obviously, the choice is up to you, though.� At press time, the Hartley Files podcast had received 5 million viewers for a multi-hour episode in which its host sat down with Alex Jones."
"Noting that such individuals had repeatedly upset the competition�s balance and atmosphere, Jeopardy! officials announced a permanent ban Tuesday on any obsessive weirdos who ruin the fun by preparing way too much for the show. �Effective immediately, we will be banning anyone who makes things awkward for the other contestants or the viewers at home by studying up on trivia for months before like total freaks,� said Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek, describing past champions like James Holzhauer and Ken Jennings as exactly the kind of neurotic assholes who turn an enjoyable little daytime game show into a bigger stage to flaunt their obsessive and unsettling level of knowledge on subjects as far-flung as the Russian czars, Caribbean literature, and Rodgers and Hammerstein showtunes. �It�s disturbing for our audience at home to picture these crackpots sitting alone in their pathetic little apartments and reading up on French architects like any of this matters. It doesn�t. People just want to kick back and unwind while watching a show after work without some complete lunatic creeping everybody out with a bizarre, all-consuming fixation on winning some dumb trivia competition.� Trebek added that he would personally screen the show�s auditions to look for anyone who starts getting one of those �strange, squirmy grins� on their faces when they know the answer to some clue about Elizabethan English."
"Feeling that the scene wasn�t completely necessary to tell the famed musician�s life story, viewers of the Elton John biopic Rocketman told reporters Thursday they were not entirely convinced the film needed to include a 45-minute scene depicting Princess Diana�s death. �I understand she was a close friend of Elton John and that it was a pivotal moment in his life and career, but to devote that much screen time to a graphic, slow-motion recreation of the car wreck that killed Lady Di seems a little over-the-top,� said local moviegoer Liam Mazolla, who observed that the filmmakers didn�t even include John�s chart-topping Diana tribute �Candle In The Wind 1997� in the sequence, but instead drown out all sound with a high-pitched ringing noise as the automobile accident unfolded. �One moment, you�re watching Elton in the studio cutting �Crocodile Rock,� and the next, it smash-cuts to that fateful car chase 25 years later. It definitely takes some liberties when it shows him arriving at the scene and playing a grand piano on the back of a flatbed truck as the rescue crews get to work. The costumes were great, though.� Viewers also expressed bafflement at the decision to roll the film�s credits over Diana�s funeral procession, complete footage of which continues for five hours before fading to black."
"Overcome with a swell of emotion while recalling the final words of Arizona senator John McCain, a tearful Meghan McCain opened up Thursday about how her late father�s dying wish was for her to be given her own daytime talk show. �My father was a genuine American hero, and it�s only right that we honor his departing wish of letting me anchor my own hit daytime talk show called Meghan In The Morning,� said a visibly choked-up McCain, claiming that her father didn�t spend five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam just for people to invoke his memory in ways that didn�t further her television career whatsoever. �It�s hard not to get emotional when I remember how he held my hand on his deathbed and declared that I deserved to be number one in my time slot. He dreamed about seeing me, and me alone, interview the biggest names in Hollywood and Washington. He�s gone now, but if we honor his wishes�as we should�his memory can live on between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on a major network like ABC, or maybe CBS. It�s what he wanted.� McCain also revealed that her father�s dying words were, �Don�t accept anything less than a $15 million contract.�"
"Working at a clip only slightly faster than usual, a team of professional songwriters spent a half hour banging out a new song that will define local teenager Destiny Cibula�s personality for the next two years, sources reported Thursday. �All right, let�s wrap this one up and get to lunch,� a 47-year-old Swedish producer said of the future chart-topper that features a chorus written in 20 seconds and that will prove formative to Cibula�s adolescence, changing the way she sees herself and, years later, encapsulating more than anything else the nostalgia she feels for her youth. �Keep it simple�hit the root, the fourth, the fifth. There we go. �You�re a bird, spread your wings, blah blah blah.� Just copy and paste the beat from whatever worked last time, as long as it�s something you can dance to at a wedding. And hurry up, I have a one o�clock reservation.� At press time, the songwriters had reportedly returned from lunch and were already putting the finishing touches on another song, this one a down-tempo number that a ninth-grade Cibula will play on repeat for hours after going through her first breakup."
"In response to the actress�s denial that the two had ever been romantically involved, musician Moby posted a long-range, blurry photo taken through a window to his Instagram page Thursday as proof that he is currently dating Natalie Portman. �Many people have taken umbrage with the characterization of the relationship we shared in the �90s, so here is a picture of Natalie taken last night at her hotel,� said Moby, who provided the fuzzy image as well as a publicity shot of Portman with a Getty image watermark as corroborating evidence that the pair had been happily together since 1999. �Natalie and I have been in love for 20 years, so it saddens me to hear people, including Natalie, say otherwise. But if we aren�t dating, then why am I always on the phone with her lawyers? Plus, if Natalie Portman and I weren�t soulmates, then why would I have all her trash?� At press time, Moby was refuting claims that the photo of the severed finger he had posted to his Instagram was taken without Portman�s consent."
"Describing his process for bringing the assassin character to life, Keanu Reeves explained to reporters Thursday how he prepared for the title role in John Wick: Chapter 3�Parabellum by acting in the two previous John Wick movies. �I realized very early on in the development stages of John Wick 3 that the only way to really get into character was to become John Wick for a few months at a time during principal photography on two separate feature-length films whose stories would lead up to this one,� said Reeves, acknowledging that his performance in the latest movie would not have been possible had he not been given the opportunity to fully explore the role by Lionsgate Films and the team that wrote, produced, shot, and released the first and second installments. �At first, I thought that taking the character�s backstory so seriously was maybe a bit pretentious and unnecessary, but the exercise was highly recommended to me by Matt Damon, who used it for The Bourne Ultimatum and loved it, so I thought I should give it a shot. In the end, it�s all about what works best for you. Some actors use the Stanislavski or Meisner techniques to build their characters, and others need to be more hands-on by making a couple multimillion-dollar prequels.� Reeves added that he hoped the same method would allow him to turn in a career-defining performance in next year�s long-awaited third installment of the Bill & Ted franchise."
"Shedding light on the difficult process of believably portraying the Game Of Thrones villain the Night King, actor Vladimir Furdik opened up to reporters Monday about the creative challenge of playing a character with absolutely no purpose whatsoever. �The Night King was a very demanding role because all my character did was just sort of stand there, so it�s on you as the actor to sell his emotions and make up for the fact that he had no narrative function,� said Furdik, explaining that in order to really get into the Night King�s mindset, he focused on thinking about ice all day long, a strategy he developed after reading all of George R.R. Martin�s books, which provided him with no additional information on how his character actually felt or fit into the series as a whole. �I kept asking David Benioff and D.B. Weiss if the Night King was going to have any meaningful impact on the story, but they kept dodging the question and telling me to �look evil.� The scene where my character killed one of the dragons was pretty cool, and I enjoyed getting to flex my acting muscles by pretending to throw a spear. Beyond that, though, all I really did was show up to set in costume. It�s tough when your character has no arc, personality, or reason to exist.� Furdik also thanked the cast mates who played Samwell Tarly and Ser Podrick Payne for understanding first-hand the struggle of portraying characters that also had no effect on the series� ultimate conclusion."
"Frustrated that two years of rigorous study have failed to yield any insight, relationship experts at Columbia University conceded Monday they have made no progress in determining what, exactly, Scarlett Johansson sees in her fianc�, Saturday Night Live star Colin Jost. �We�ve ruled out the possibility Ms. Johansson is attracted to Mr. Jost�s wealth or status, as she is the highest-paid actress in the world and, unlike her partner, widely admired in her field,� said Columbia sociologist Dana Gourley, adding that researchers were unable to formulate a plausible hypothesis of what the couple even talks about, given that the �Weekend Update� anchor appears to possess no personality traits that could be deemed interesting or appealing. �Furthermore, we know her attraction to him can�t be merely physical because repeated surveys, facial-symmetry analysis, and other standard metrics confirm Ms. Johansson is dramatically better looking than Mr. Jost. We simply cannot pinpoint what he has to offer her. We have to throw out every scientific model of human attraction ever devised and start over.� Gourley and her colleagues went on to present data showing it would make far more sense for Scarlett Johansson to be engaged to Kevin Nealon or even Norm Macdonald."
"Saying their once-beloved viewers have lost much of their luster in recent years, Game Of Thrones showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff acknowledged Friday they have been frustrated with the way fans of the HBO series have declined in quality over the past few seasons. �During the show�s first couple of years, our viewers showed a lot of promise and challenged our assumptions about what a fan base could be,� Benioff told reporters, lamenting the fact that when Game Of Thrones moved past George R.R. Martin�s original source material, the show�s supporters began to lose coherence and now barely resemble the industry-defining audience they once were. �At this point, however, they�ve become a tired clich�. It�s hard to watch them lose everything that made us love them in the first place. Nothing they do makes any sense anymore, and it just seems like they want the show to be over with as quickly as possible. It�s pretty sad, to be honest.� At press time, Benioff and Weiss expressed regret that they failed to do more to prevent the fans from becoming so unbelievably shitty."
"Facing a backlash over what is perhaps the show�s most confounding move to date, producers for ABC�s The Bachelorette attempted to fend off criticism Monday for its controversial decision to feature a 13-year-old girl in the titular role of the program�s latest season. �She may be a little younger than our past bachelorettes, but we�re confident Kayla will win over viewers� hearts with her love of horses, soccer, and chocolate-chip ice cream,� said ABC spokesperson Marianne Weatherby, who defended the network�s choice to cast the seventh-grader in a show in which, over the course of a dozen episodes, 30 male contestants will vie for the child�s affections and hand in marriage. �When our casting agent first brought her in, we had concerns as well, but the more time we spent with Kayla, the more we loved her�and we think you will too. We apologize to anyone who may feel offended, but at this point we�ve already filmed the entire season. Plus, none of the male contestants gave us any complaints.� Weatherby went on to reveal that Kayla had hit it off right away with the season�s youngest suitor, Richard, a 46-year-old mechanic from Kalispell, MT."
"In what television audience-representation advocates are terming a long-overdue change to an archaic system, NBC announced Wednesday that popular singing competition show The Voice has amended its rules to allow viewers who aren�t white landowning males to cast their votes in the show�s 17th season. �Until recently, the polling system on The Voice was a prejudiced anachronism, a relic from an unfortunate period of our history. We no longer live in the dark, backward days of 2011. It�s time for a change,� said NBC spokesperson Sarah Simari, explaining that the Founding Showrunners originally believed the only viewers educated and responsible enough to make judgments of vocal performances were respectable upper or middle-class white males who owned property. �It�s about time we recognize that women and minorities can judge an overcooked amateur cover of Nina Simone�s �Feeling Good� just as well as any white man. Hopefully, these new changes will ensure that the winner of the record deal and $100,000 prize will reflect the opinions of free people everywhere.� Representatives of rival network ABC announced they will work on amending the rules of American Idol, which currently counts Lionel Richie�s votes as worth three-fifths those of a white person."
"Unrelenting in her dedication to dazzle at the annual Met Gala event, a visibly exhausted Lady Gaga proclaimed �Voila!� Tuesday afternoon during her 149th consecutive costume change as museum visitors gingerly stepped over her. �Behold�I am a butterfly�now witness the monarch�s metamorphosis!� said the international superstar and event hostess, who appeared pale and dehydrated as a group of confused German tourists avoided treading on the hundred-pound piles of taffeta and silk discarded around her. �Abandon the cocoon, my babies�we were born to soar! Wait, I have more. Come back. Would anybody help me undo this clasp? My designer, where is my designer?� At press time, Lady Gaga emerged from a pile of wigs and helped a lost visitor locate the ancient Egyptian temple.�"
"Heralding the three-hour experience as �a mature, cinematic triumph beyond its time,� film critics offered high praise Tuesday for the single long, unbroken take a theater parent employed to capture a Desert Shadows Middle School production of Guys And Dolls. �The breathtaking decision to tell this story in a single, uninterrupted shot is brilliant, courageous, and unlike anything I�ve ever seen before on screen. Absolutely masterful,� said Hollywood Reporter critic Jon Frosch in his litany of praise for Hannah Malloy�s dad, Andy, noting his commitment to the craft in setting up his tripod six full minutes before the show began and then leaving the lens cap on the camera through the entire opening number, challenging the viewer to rely on senses other than mere sight�and their faith in the performers�in order to enmesh themselves in the musical performance. �During �Luck Be A Lady Tonight,� Malloy managed to zoom in and out on nearly every person onstage before panning around the entire auditorium to capture the audience�s response, a technique never before attempted in my professional experience. He depended on no cuts, quick or otherwise, employed no trickery, and never once fell back on the crutch of editing. At one point, Mr. Malloy can even be heard asking his wife where the back-up battery is before handing the camera to her while he rifles through his bag�simply breathtaking verit�. I also hope Mr. Malloy inspires more filmmakers to provide an intermission to give the viewer time to reflect on the experience and use the restroom if needed.� Critics added, at the risk of cursing Malloy with anticipation, that they �cannot wait� to see his adaptation of the eighth-grade graduation ceremony this June."
"Revealing at long last the creative process behind a successful career during which he has written over 300 books, best-selling children�s author R.L. Stine disclosed during an interview Monday that all of his writing is dictated to him directly by God. �One morning, I was walking in the woods behind my house when lo! I suddenly heard the voice of the Lord ring out, commanding me to transcribe His message. I fell to my knees and received His divine command to publish His truths, verbatim, in a series of 120-page horror fiction books for kids to purchase at Scholastic book fairs across the country,� said Stine, insisting he could never take full credit for classics such as Say Cheese And Die or Phantom Of The Auditorium, as he had merely served as a conduit for the teachings of the divine Creator. �It could have been anyone on Earth, but He chose me to act as a herald of His voice and a vessel for His words, and I feel truly humbled. There were times when I cursed the tremendous burden of channeling The Supreme Being, and I often asked myself, �Why me? Why must I be the one to write Under The Magician�s Spell?� But I knew there was a higher purpose for me, much like that revealed in the divine text of Stay Out Of The Basement.� Stine noted that like many readers, he, too, still wrestles with accepting that Slappy the Dummy is actually the next Messiah."
"Expressing disappointment that the beloved series had evidently been tainted by corporate interests, Game Of Thrones fans across the nation were annoyed Sunday at the show�s increasingly frequent and obvious product placement for Valyrian steel. �It�s just so gross and artificial. They really go out of their way to talk up Valyrian steel over and over again,� said local Game Of Thrones fan Emily Lopez, explaining that her exasperation with the overtly corporate-minded HBO producers had reached a boiling point following a recent scene that seemed to exist for no other reason than for one character to �ooh and ahh� over a Valyrian steel sword given to him as a gift. �I mean, I get it, they have to pay the bills somehow, but it�s getting ridiculous. Valyrian steel basically has the whole show in their pockets, and now it�s like every episode is just a commercial for high-end swords and spears. It�s so distracting.� Lopez also expressed her growing frustration with the show�s increasingly frequent mentions of brand-name Dragonglass."
"Reflecting fondly on the television appearance that launched the K-pop group into superstardom, members of BTS told reporters Thursday that they were excited to be back in America for the first time since their 1963 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show. �Nothing will compare to the thrill of hearing Mr. Sullivan introduce us as a �few fine young men from South Korea� way back when, but it�s still great to reconnect with fans in the States after nearly six decades,� said band vocalist Jimin, who called the show�s host �a true class act� for putting them on the bill of the November 3, 1963 episode headlined by Sid Caesar and ventriloquist Rickie Layne. �Obviously, you could barely hear us playing �We On� over all the teenagers screaming, but even at the time, I knew this was going to change our lives forever.� BTS members went on to describe their hopes that their fame had died down enough that they could enjoy exploring America this time without covering their faces with newspapers or hiding inside phone booths."
"Saying the pop superstar�s opener felt strikingly familiar, music fans accused Taylor Swift of ripping off Beyonc� Wednesday when she gave birth to twins during her performance at the Billboard Music Awards. �Sure, Beyonc� doesn�t own the copyright on pregnancy, but to the millions who watched last night as Taylor delivered a baby boy and girl onstage at the MGM Grand, it sure felt like plagiarism,� wrote entertainment blogger Emily Brooks, who cited Swift�s �total lack of creativity� in imitating Beyonc� so closely, from the birthing of fraternal twins right down to the ultimate decision to undergo an emergency C-section at her doctor�s discretion. �I understand that great minds often think alike, but this was way over the line. Even the sound Taylor made during labor before being rushed into the NICU was basically a carbon copy. You can�t just go around stealing other people�s ideas�especially when you�re stealing from the queen.� Brooks added that it was particularly unscrupulous for Swift to bring Jay-Z out onstage and announce that she had named her newborn children Sir Carter II and Rumi Carter II."
"Animal experts praised the upcoming animated film Sonic: The Hedgehog Tuesday for its accurate depiction of hedgehogs, noting that most media representations leave out the creature�s tendency to roll up into a fast-moving blue ball to attack enemy combatants. �Most of the hedgehogs we see in film and TV are portrayed as timid, antisocial creatures, which completely glosses over both the frequent smoke trails they leave in their lightning-fast wake and their daily ritual of battling their natural enemy, the nefarious mad scientist,� said University of Illinois zoologist Dr. Krista Keller, adding that the 6-inch woodland dweller Americans typically see only exists on the silver screen, while the common hedgehog is approximately 3 feet tall, stands on two sneaker-clad feet, and zooms through city streets to save our planet from sure destruction. �The creators of Sonic really did their homework by exploring the life of our glowing, neon-blue little friends that arrived from Mobius with such precision and care. This is exciting, too, because the quiet, plodding hedgehog you�re familiar with pales in comparison to the real ones I work with as a veterinary professor. I�m much more accustomed to observing hedgehogs that crackle with electricity and run up the side of skyscrapers and jump off buildings to escape the dreaded Dr. Robotnik, all the while tossing out clever quips in plain English.� Dr. Keller added that the film, unfortunately, appears to present yet another unrealistic depiction of James Marsden."
"Revealing the secret behind his lucrative run on the TV game show, unbeatable Jeopardy! champion James Holzhauer told reporters Tuesday that the key to his success was threatening other contestants with a nail-studded baseball bat during commercial breaks. �My approach is pretty simple: I wait until a few seconds before a new round starts, get the other players� attention, and tell them I�ll bash in their goddamn skulls if I don�t win,� said Holzhauer, 34, who explained that he had managed to win over $1 million in only 15 games by gripping the bat tightly, taking a few swings near the heads of the other contestants, and stowing the bat behind his podium before taping restarted to emphasize that a potential beating was only moments away. �It�s really all about timing. You have to menace them with the nail-studded baseball bat before each and every round so they�re absolutely terrified to buzz in before you do. You also have to remember that the clock�s ticking and you only have a couple minutes of ads to warn the other players that you�ll cave their fucking faces in and splatter their brains all over the set if they cross you. It�s really less about knowing a lot of trivia, although that�s definitely important, than it is to be able to really hone in on how you�ll bludgeon them to a bloody pulp before attacking any of their loved ones in the studio audience if you lose.� Holzhauer added that he believed his strategy to be more effective than that of fellow Jeopardy! legend Ken Jennings, who has said the key to his success was holding a gun to his head before the Final Jeopardy! round and threatening to blow his brains out if he didn�t win."
"Admitting they were confounded by the huge numbers being put up by the 2001 feature starring Jason Biggs, Steve Zahn, and Jack Black, top film industry analysts told reporters Monday they had yet to determine how Saving Silverman managed to break numerous box office records over the weekend. �As far as we know, this movie doesn�t really have much of a cult following, so it�s kind of weird that it was showing on enough screens to take in $400 million domestically during a span of three days,� said box office forecaster Errol Kaucher, who reached out to several of the 5,000 theaters screening the film in an effort to determine how they all independently decided to run the nearly two-decade-old buddy comedy, reportedly without even consulting each other. �To be clear, this isn�t a remake. It�s the original movie. Everyone�s money was on Avengers: Endgame taking it all last weekend, but somehow Saving Silverman came along and blew it out of the water. [Director] Dennis Dugan has had box office success before with Grown Ups, but we really didn�t think he was capable of anything like this. We did have an early indication something was up after hearing about sold-out theaters in the select cities that got a sneak-peak of Saving Silverman on Thursday. Still, this pretty much came out of nowhere.� At press time, analysts confirmed they were again confounded after learning Saving Silverman had resonated deeply with Chinese audiences and grossed an additional $1 billion overseas.�"
"Expressing deep disappointment as their beloved series begins to come to a long-awaited conclusion, crestfallen Game Of Thrones fans reported Monday their realization that the show is never going to show dragons fucking. �I�ve put hundreds of hours of my life into this series, and now it seems it�s all been a waste,� said self-described Song Of Ice And Fire �superfan� Aaron Tremaine, 31, recounting how his initial excitement at the beginning of each new season shifted to sadness after being repeatedly deprived of steamy dragon-on-dragon sex. �Of course, I didn�t expect it to happen in the very first scene of the pilot, but I figured it had to happen eventually. They spent so many episodes building up the whole �will-they-won�t-they� tension with Drogon and Rhaegal, and now it seems like it�s never going to pay off. It�s devastating, especially as I�m told it�s such a big part of the books.� Tremaine, like many fans of the show, remains optimistic that the final episodes may include some dragon oral sex or �at least some claw stuff.�"
"Emphasizing that a democracy must guarantee its people the right to openly discuss the fact that Episode 9 will be titled The Rise Of Skywalker without fear of censorship, the nation admitted Friday that they only care about free speech for imparting details about Star Wars shit. �The Bill of Rights guarantees Americans the freedom to assemble, namely at Comic-Con, and the freedom to speak, ideally during a Q&A panel with J.J. Abrams or George Lucas where we maybe even get to see a little teaser footage,� said Cleveland resident Doug Mandeville, 51, echoing a populace that confirmed it would fight tooth and nail to protect the First Amendment inasmuch as it applies to an individual�s right to post crap on Instagram about the upcoming Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order video game. �We owe so much to the Founding Fathers for taking such great pains to ensure we would all one day be able to go online and receive free and fair access to the film�s trailer, stills of Billy Dee Williams� return as Lando, and information on how Rian Johnson�s vision for the franchise may have been altered. Other than that, the entire U.S. Constitution is something we could take or leave.� At press time, the nation stressed the freedom of speech does not apply to spoilers."
"In the hopes that the experience provides a valuable lesson about adherence to the law, Judge Steve Kim responded to Lori Loughlin�s money laundering, bribery, and racketeering charges Friday by sentencing the former Full House actress to 100 hours of community theatre. �As punishment for the dishonesty, flippancy, and disregard for the law Ms. Loughlin has displayed, I�ve sentenced her to perform in a minimum of 12 different community theatre productions around the greater Los Angeles area,� said Judge Kim, who expressed his intention of sending a message to all those who believe themselves to be above the law through the actress�s mandatory court-ordered participation in small-scale productions of The Pajama Game, Oklahoma, Little Shop of Horrors, and an upcoming modern retelling of The Crucible. �Loughlin will be required to run lines with a designated sponsor to ensure she�s completely off-book for each production, and learn all necessary choreography and blocking. She will even be required to work as a grip when needed. Everyone should know what it�s like to work for weeks on a play that goes up for an audience of nine people�if Ms. Loughlin had known what was at stake, perhaps she would have thought twice about her crimes.� At press time, the judge had added an extra punishment to the sentence requiring Loughlin to also appear at the poorly attended basement cast parties following the conclusion of each production."
"Committing to a strict age-reduction diet and infantilizing exercise regimen in preparation for the role, infamously dedicated method actor Christian Bale revealed Friday that he lost 40 years in order to portray 5-year-old composer prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the prestige historical drama Wunderkind. �I knew it would be physically taxing, and possibly even dangerous, to do something like this, but my age-regression trainers are the absolute best and saw to it that I never shed more than 10 years in a given week,� said the Oscar-winning actor and functional kindergartener who worked with speech pathologists and physical therapists to degrade his verbal and motor skills, respectively. �When I signed up to play a young Mozart, I knew I�d have to immerse myself in the role. I was able to drop the first few decades pretty quickly, actually, but I plateaued hard around 15, and those last 10 years were a bit of a slog. We�re still in production right now, but my next role sees me playing the wizard Merlin, so I�ll have to pack on another 180 years soon. Going through puberty again will be an ordeal, I�m sure, but with any luck, I�ll be legal drinking age in time for the Wunderkind wrap party.� Sources involved with production on Wunderkind said the project is dangerously over budget and will likely shut down over a lack of funding."
"Confirming the widely held theory that, hoo boy, that dame sure is somethin�, a study released Monday by researchers at UCLA found that they just don�t make �em like Ginger Rogers anymore. �After an exhaustive five-year survey of thousands of little numbers who may be real firecrackers but ain�t even a patch on Ginger Rogers, we concluded that there�s no two ways about it: That twinkle-toed little pigeon must be the finest damn thing to ever strut her stuff on the silver screen,� said lead author Dr. Alan Grayson, adding that their data suggest God really broke the mold with Ginger Rogers and, moreover, that any square from Delaware would flip his wig seeing them gams of hers in Kitty Foyle. �We found, furthermore, that whether she�s cutting some rug in Swing Time and Flying Down To Rio or breaking hearts in Top Hat, there�s just no game Ginger Rogers can�t ace. In short, Ginger Rogers is a once-in-a-millennium talent and not since Harlow has Hollywood seen a star of her caliber, if you�re pickin� up what I�m puttin� down, brother.� Grayson also noted that the survey conclusively proved Fred Astaire was one three-times-lucky sum�bitch."
"Left aghast at a segment depicting the cruel realities of life in the Arctic wilderness, viewers of the new Netflix docuseries Our Planet were reportedly shocked Friday to witness narrator David Attenborough step into the frame to break the neck of a starving polar bear. �The scene was about a mama polar bear looking for food, and then, all of a sudden, the music stops and you hear David Attenborough yelling, �Someone needs to put her down!�� said viewer Chris Dorff, who expressed his utter bafflement at watching the 92-year-old Attenborough pin down a feeble, emaciated polar bear and brutally snap her head around 180 degrees, after which the camera cuts to unrelated footage of Canada geese. �He held the dying bear in his arms and whispered, �Easy, girl,� over and over, telling her she wouldn�t have to suffer anymore. Then, he looked at the camera and started talking about how we are all part of one planet, and some things must die so that others may live. It was pretty intense.� Sources confirmed the episode�s credits roll over a shot of Attenborough standing on the deck of a boat harpooning diseased narwhals."
"Calling its musical cue of �Paramount trumpet theme� a perfect choice, Paramount Pictures executive Michael Ryan quickly snapped up a script Friday that began with a series of animated stars swooping through the clouds before joining the studio�s logo and fading into an establishing shot of an actual mountain. �A lot of screenplays come across my desk, but when I saw �PARAMOUNT LOGO DESCENDS INTO FRAME,� I knew this one was special,� said the vice president of development, who reportedly made an offer as soon as the stage directions indicated the words �A Viacom Company� would fade in on the bottom third of the screen. �I was hooked from page one. From the slow-zoom on the Paramount logo to the three-second static shot of the Paramount logo, it just has Paramount Pictures written all over it. When we got on the phone, I told this guy, �Listen, I just can�t see this anywhere else but Paramount,� and then we acquired it for $1.2 million on the spot.� At press time, sources confirmed the screenwriter had pulled out of the deal and decided to take the script to Universal Studios."
"Tantalizing fans with glimpses of Dothraki and Northmen joining together to can-can across Westeros, a new trailer for the final Game Of Thrones season provided a sneak peek Friday at the show�s climactic 25-minute all-cast dance number. �This, obviously, is what the series has been building toward since season one,� said executive producer David Benioff, who was able to divulge that the final episode, titled �Dragons A-Go-Go,� would bring audiences to the edge of their seats not merely with several shocking revelations, but with a $15-million CGI sequence featuring the Night King �really breaking it down� in a three-minute hip-hop-inspired duet captured in a single camera shot and featuring a guest appearance by Lin-Manuel Miranda. �I think fans are going to completely forget about the long wait once they see 10,000 wildlings joining in a Busby-Berkeley-style kaleidoscope that culminates with Bran dramatically rising from his wheelchair to dance the bachata with Daenerys Targaryen. Even some of the characters we�ve lost in previous seasons will make an appearance as we pan up to the sky for a raucous rendition of �Celebrate� led by a clapping, headless Ned Stark. While this ending diverges in some ways from George�s original vision�he wanted something more West Side Story�I think we�ve stayed true to his larger themes of power, soft-shoe, and betrayal.� Benioff would not confirm the rumor that more than half of the four-hour series finale is an extended Bollywood-style dance number midway through the closing credits."
"Touting the tickets as offering the best experience for fans of the music festival, Coachella organizers on Thursday reportedly unveiled premium VIP areas where fans will be able to see and hear the bands. �For just $1,299, our special VIP passes give festival attendees parking, admission to the campground, and exclusive access to the only areas in the entire festival from which you can hear and see live music,� said Coachella spokesperson Melanie Watters, adding that general admission tickets were also on sale for those festivalgoers who were interested in seeing or hearing the bands, but not both. �And for just $399 more, we�re offering a limited run of passes that will allow access to a cordoned-off special section where you can get within 200 feet of the stage. If you want to be within visual distance of the bands you love and came to the festival to hear audible levels of sound, these are the only passes that will allow you to do that. VIP pass-holders will also be the only ones permitted in our special bathroom section, which provides the only bathrooms on festival grounds, and it�s just $50 more to enter a bathroom with a functioning toilet.� At press time, organizers expressed bafflement after learning they hadn�t sold any of the VIP passes."
"Saying �No, no, no� to himself as he worked his way down the page, a desperate Matt Damon reportedly spent Thursday fervently searching for his name on IMDB user Dolphinsoul60�s list, �Top 100 Actors.� �Jason Bateman...Chris Evans�Gene Hackman? C�mon, c�mon, Dolphinsoul60. Where is your boy?� said the Hollywood leading man to himself, pausing only to take a look at number 54 on the list, but slamming his fist after seeing it was �Matt Dillon� and not �Matt Damon.� �Harry Dean Stanton is on here? Jesus Christ. I get it if I�m not in the top 10, but you�d think I�d at least be top 100. Have they even seen Good Will Hunting? Maybe I just missed it. I�ll scroll back up.� At press time, Damon had perked up after spotting his picture on a different list, having not yet noticed it was Dolphinsoul60�s �Top 25 Most Overrated Actors."
"Following revelations about the actress�s alleged involvement in a college bribery scandal, University of Southern California officials told reporters Tuesday that Lori Loughlin�s daughter was admitted solely based on her socioeconomic background. �We certainly condemn bribery, but we would also like to acknowledge that USC student Olivia Jade earned her way here just like every other freshman: By having lucked into growing up in the right zip code,� said spokesperson Sara McLaren, explaining that the 19-year-old Bel Air native demonstrated that she was Trojan material by listing an elite all-girls private school with a nearly $40,000-per-year tuition on her Common Application. �Since our founding in 1880, applicants have been assessed purely on strength of social class, and Olivia�s name jumped right off the page. From extracurriculars that are exclusive to the top 1 percent, to college prep classes exclusive to the top 1 percent, to recommendation letters from other members of the top 1 percent, Olivia gained entrance to USC on her economic merit and her economic merit alone.� McLaren added that the YouTube personality also appealed to admissions officers by offering a diversity in perspective to her freshman class with her experiences of growing up a celebrity."
"Criticizing the network for the cruel and unusual treatment, inmate rights groups blasted CBS programming executives Friday after evidence revealing the use of prison laughter on their sitcoms became public. �Evidently, incarcerated men and women are forced to sit and watch hour after hour of live taping. Witnesses say that if guards aren�t pleased with the volume and frequency of laughs produced�demand can sometimes be as high as 15 laughs a minute�inmates can be thrown in solitary confinement. This is just wrong,� said Samantha Aguerra, a spokesperson for the prisoners� rights group Jailhouse Lawyers Speak, who added that many prisoners agree to the grueling, thankless �sweetening� task and are not informed that studies show working in a CBS studio audience increases violent tendencies as well as the risk of recidivism. �It�s inhumane for a person to spend long, uncomfortable hours in a regimented environment where human functions, such as outbursts of laughter and bathroom breaks, are strictly scheduled. People don�t want to think about where the laughter and applause on their favorite shows come from, but it�s on all of them�Everybody Loves Raymond, Young Sheldon, 2 Broke Girls. I don�t know what the studio audiences of these shows did to get sent to prison, but no one deserves to watch this and be expected to laugh. It�s disgusting that the same questionable practices that gave us Sanford and Son are still in use today.� Aguerra added that, upon their release, many inmates find they are unable to get jobs working at CBS due to the network�s distrust of former audience members"
"Following an explosive report into allegedly abusive conduct, sources confirmed Colton Underwood, star of the current season of The Bachelor, was accused Thursday of leveraging his power as a reality television personality to lure and entrap 30 women in a California mansion. �Mr. Underwood convinced these women they were going to be wealthy and famous if they came to live with him in this house and showered him with attention,� an official investigating the case said on condition of anonymity, detailing how the 27-year-old former NFL practice squad player manipulated women at the mansion, where he promptly seized control of all aspects of their lives, including what they wore, what they ate, and when they could speak to him. �There�s a real power dynamic here. He gives them the sense they�re special by taking them on hot tub dates and beach trips. He engages in fear tactics with �rose ceremonies� in which he threatens to exile those he deems insufficiently devoted. He�ll even corner them alone on one-on-ones. And meanwhile, this pervert is filming the whole thing.� At press time, authorities were reportedly panicking after realizing Underwood had fled the country with a handful of the women in a jet bound for the tropics."
"Scoring an inside scoop on the new celebrity couple, the tabloid website TMZ revealed Wednesday that Pete Davidson and Kate Beckinsale�s relationship is no more than a public-relations ploy orchestrated to raise the profile of the New York Rangers. �We�re in seventh place, the season�s winding down, and we need to do something to get people to pay attention to this team for the next month,� read a leaked email from Rangers publicist Kerry Stevens, who reportedly introduced the 25-year-old Saturday Night Live star and 45-year-old Pearl Harbor actress, convincing them to exchange long, deep kisses in order to foster fan interest. �With Pete and Kate on our team, we can show New Yorkers that no matter who�s winning, there�s still no better place to publicly make out with your date than right here by the ice in Madison Square Garden.� At press time, sources confirmed the Rangers� five-game losing streak had prompted team officials to abandon the plan for all remaining home games and instead keep the Jumbotron camera continuously trained on a grimacing Christian Slater."
"Noting that the timing of the allegations appeared to be �a little too perfect,� a lawyer representing Michael Jackson�s estate questioned Wednesday why those accusing the late pop icon of child sexual abuse had only come forward steadily since the early 1990s. �It seems awfully convenient that all these people suddenly decided to come out of the woodwork on a regular basis over the course of a quarter century,� said Jonathan Steinsapir, explaining that he also found it quite suspicious that some had chosen to make their accusations as grown men instead of doing so back in the �90s like so many other children did. �This all seems like quite the coincidence to me. Are we to believe that one man with access to a private Peter Pan�themed ranch, a multimillion-dollar legal team, and a rabid fanbase willing to ignore his considerable eccentricities could just molest a bunch of kids without us finding out about more than a handful of them per year since 1992? That�s a bit far-fetched.� Steinsapir added that suspecting a grown man of sexual misconduct simply because he made a habit of inviting underage fans to sleepovers in which they shared his bed was unfair and �frankly just cynical.�"
"Arguing that the streaming service has severely hamstrung the ability of directors to create saccharine, artistically meritless garbage, Steven Spielberg criticized Netflix Tuesday for ruining the golden age of pandering big-budget films produced by media conglomerates. �We were living in a wonderful era of insipid franchise-driven blockbusters when, suddenly, Netflix comes along and screws everything up by giving a platform to underrepresented directors and helping connect audiences across the globe to risk-taking, idiosyncratic films that would never be made by a major studio,� said the director of Ready Player One and Jurassic Park, blasting the streaming service for sabotaging the halcyon days of lowest-common-denominator cinema that gave viewers absolutely no credit and merely indulged their basest instincts. �They should be ashamed. They�ve single-handedly put an end to dull, inoffensive films that privilege melodrama and spectacle over substance, not to mention the fact that they�ve eroded the influence of executives who only care about producing movies that make as much money as possible. There were so many great artists, myself included, who sold out decades ago and, as a result, no longer have the ability to make a movie as resonant as, say, Roma. What will happen to us?� At press time, Steven Spielberg quickly retracted all of his comments and began praising Netflix after the company offered him a multimillion-dollar, two-picture deal."
"In an effort to create the illusion that the horrific decapitation was deliberate, Game Of Thrones producers were frantically re-shooting the series finale Tuesday to make Peter Dinklage�s death seem intentional. �Christ, okay, shit, maybe we can get some B-roll footage to establish a visual explanation for Peter�s head being chopped off by that piece of lighting equipment that came loose and plummeted to the ground,� said executive producer David Benioff, scrambling to set up a shot with a character wielding a bloody axe to justify why Dinklage was headless on the floor. �Come on, people, we don�t have much time here. Let�s get some makeup on Peter�s face to fix that discolored skin. Clean up that blood, but save it, don�t throw it out, that stuff looks pretty realistic on camera. Alright, tape Peter�s head back on and let�s nail this scene.� At press time, the producers were thrilled after the hyper-realistic final beheading scene turned out even better than what was originally in the script."
"Addressing the speculation that has circulated on social media since Sunday�s Academy Awards broadcast, Lady Gaga made an announcement this week to quash any rumors that she ever thought Bradley Cooper was talented in any way. �A lot of gossip has been floating around about the two of us, so let me assure you that not once have I ever felt that Bradley Cooper possessed any real skills or anything resembling artistic merit,� said the Oscar-winning songwriter, noting that if she conveyed any sign of respect toward the man who directed and appeared with her in the film A Star Is Born, she was simply doing her job as an actor. �The only reason people think I have a high regard for his craft is because, as performers, that�s what we want you to think. In reality, I don�t feel that way about him at all, and I hope this puts an end to any theories out there that I have ever considered Bradley to be anything more than a complete and utter hack.� When reached for comment, Bradley Cooper told reporters that he is a huge fan of Lady Gaga, has been a huge fan of Lady Gaga since the first time he ever saw her, and would leave his partner and child to commit himself completely to Lady Gaga and her career if she would only say the word."
"In response to a film featuring two men who say that the singer sexually abused them as children, the estate of Michael Jackson released a new documentary Friday alleging that the King of Pop gets a lifetime pass for Thriller. �The claim we lay out in our documentary is that whatever bad things that pop icon Michael Jackson has done, they should be swept under the rug for writing �Billie Jean� and �Beat It,�� read a statement by the estate accompanying the debut of the Sony-produced documentary, Don�t Be Startin� Somethin� adding that they hoped the film would expose the truth that the artistic achievements of the 33-time platinum album should �more than cancel out� any indiscretions Jackson committed after its 1982 release. �Whether he drugged and molested children simply doesn�t matter when you consider how Jackson changed the game with those dance moves in the video for �Billie Jean,� and these allegations simply ignore the complexity of the album�s assertive, dynamic musical production coupled with its introspective lyrics. We hope that our documentary will finally give fans of Jackson�s work the chance to reflect on how mind-blowingly innovative his music was and how whatever else he did just doesn�t matter.� The Jackson estate refused to respond to criticisms that the documentary was trying to whitewash the singer�s past by leaving out any mention of Thriller�s first single, �The Girl Is Mine.�"
"Still seething with anger nearly 90 years after the announcement, the U.S. populace revealed Monday that they were still outraged that the 1933 Oscar for Best Picture went to historical epic Cavalcade rather than the pre-code comedy Lady For A Day. �Look, Cavalcade was a fine popcorn flick, but better than Capra�s Lady For A Day? Really? I�m sorry, but I�ll never forgive the Academy for that horseshit decision,� said New York resident Elliot Spencer, who echoed the near-unanimous sentiment of 323 million Americans in noting that not a day has gone by since the 1933 awards when he doesn�t find himself shaking with rage at the insult of depriving director Frank Capra the industry�s top honor and to instead reward such a paint-by-the-numbers, pandering piece of filmmaking. �The other day, I had a screaming match with a friend who said Cavalcade wasn�t really that bad. Seriously? I can�t think of a single greater injustice than seeing that hack Frank Lloyd onstage stealing Best Picture from Capra. God, I�m getting so fucking angry right now just remembering it.� At press time, the entire nation was stressing that they did think Green Book probably deserved to win this year."
"Grimacing and tossing a cup of water on his face as the spectators cheered him on, a sweating, exhausted Christian Bale was spotted Sunday evening stumbling past the 13-mile marker on the Oscars� red carpet. According to witnesses, the panting Bale had completely sweat through his tuxedo as he passed the red carpet midpoint, about two hours after the Oscars starter gun was fired. The actor reportedly staggered through a scattering of plastic water cups on the carpet as he retrieved a pack of energy gel from waist bag before pulling up behind the E! pace car to answer a question from Ryan Seacrest about working with Adam McKay. At press time, Bale had passed the 20-mile marker as a nearby Jennifer Lawrence doubled over and puked onto the red carpet."
"Shedding light on a possible key plot point of the upcoming film Avengers: Endgame, an emerging theory among fans of the Marvel franchise suggests the key to beating Thanos could be nothing, nothing at all, because he isn�t real and none of this exists, sources reported Tuesday. �They left plenty of Easter eggs hinting at it in the first three Avengers movies, so it�s pretty obvious�the way to counter Thanos� power now that he has all the infinity stones must be to simply realize he�s CGI and that it�s just a movie,� Avengers fan Raoul Bengston wrote in an online forum, detailing the potential implications of the villain being completely imaginary, including the possibility that the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe could itself be a wholly fabricated world devised decades ago by comic book writers. �Imagine what it would mean if, instead of T�Challa and Peter Parker disintegrating at the end of Infinity War, they turned out to be fictional characters portrayed by professional actors Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland, who ultimately survive because the infinity stones aren�t real? Could be quite a game-changer.� At press time, the majority of fans on the forum had begun to tear into the new theory, deeming it �far-fetched� and �unrealistic.��"
"Suggesting that the partnership would elevate the brand to new levels of cultural prominence, Adidas CEO Kasper R�rsted announced Monday that rapper Kanye West had agreed to become the new face of Yeezy. �We just feel Mr. West represents the values of this brand perfectly,� said R�rsted, adding that the hip-hop mogul had impressed the entire management team with his deep and unflinching commitment to all things Yeezy. �Honestly, we don�t know why we didn�t do this sooner, because it seems like such a natural fit. From posters to shoes, Kanye has really proven himself to be the ideal brand ambassador for everything Yeezy has to offer. He even wrote us several lengthy letters expressing his enthusiasm for the company. We�ve also discussed the possibility of using some of Kanye�s music in our commercials.� At press time, R�rsted thanked departing spokesperson J.K. Simmons for his years of dedication to team Yeezy."
"Once more breathing life into the countless rumors and fan theories that have swirled since the series began, HBO released a new Game Of Thrones trailer Wednesday that suggests the eighth and final season will at long last reveal the identity of the hit show�s sword-covered chair. �We�re excited to finally address the question viewers have been asking all along: Who is the mysterious seat with all those blades on it?� said series co-creator David Benioff, adding that while many currently suspect the oversized piece of metal furniture is a Stark or a member of another ruling family, viewers must not rule out the possibility of it being a commoner, a White Walker, or even a warg. �We�ve dropped subtle hints throughout the series, of course. Some believe the big chair made out of swords is a Bolton because it was spared during the Red Wedding, while others read its hunger for power as a Lannister trait. The trailer cuts away right before Daenerys is about to divulge the big secret, so you�ll just have to tune in to find out what happens next.� At press time, leaked footage from the upcoming series finale confirmed that, just moments before its identity is revealed, the sword-covered chair is melted down for scrap, leaving its identity a mystery forever."
"Fretting over what such a display of weakness would do to his reputation, local man Neil Rockfield told sources Thursday he was afraid of seeming vulnerable if he reached out to the fire department for help with an out-of-control blaze. �I always learned growing up that a real man puts out his own house fire, and I�ll just feel so lame letting them know I can�t deal with this,� said Rockfield, adding that just the idea of putting himself out there and admitting he couldn�t handle a raging fire in his living room and kitchen made him feel sick to his stomach. �The awkwardness of talking to a complete stranger on the phone and saying, �Hey, can you help me?� is too much. They�ll probably want to know how bad it is, too. I don�t know if I can humiliate myself by asking another grown adult to drive a fire truck over here. My dad would have never done something like this.� At press time, Rockfield decided to go to bed and see how he felt about the situation in the morning."
"Watching with growing discomfort as the 75-year-old groaned and winced in pain, college student Gordon Cheng expressed concern Wednesday during a visit home upon realizing that his grandfather was able to land only a single flying crane backflip kick while fighting off a group of intruders. �It�s sad that all these creaks and wheezes are coming from a man I�m used to seeing execute a perfect wall run, jab two assailants precisely in the groin, and cleanly decapitate a third with a rising crescent kick,� said Cheng, who claimed his heart sank while watching the elder Cheng, a master who once fought off entire clans without breaking a sweat, pause to carefully grip a staircase railing for support before kicking a goon through a wall. �It�s not just his strength; he�s losing a lot of dexterity, too, as you can see by the way he struggled to grasp that last man�s head before snapping his neck. We�re definitely going to need to keep an eye on him�no one wants to get that call telling us he slipped and fell off a roof during a midnight showdown somewhere. Logically, I know that the only reason he brought my twin sister and I back to the Divine Fortress was to eventually take over his legacy, but man, I didn�t think it would be so soon.� Cheng has made the difficult decision to look into at-home nursing services upon discovering that his grandfather was unable to remember where he had stored his emergency stash of plum blossom sticks."
"Finding himself deeply satisfied upon learning that his alpha classmate�s life turned out nearly as shitty as his own, local automotive upholstery repairman Josh Vick, 29, felt deeply validated Thursday upon discovering that Luke Morris, one of the most popular kids in his high school class, had bottomed out almost as much as he himself has. �It�s really satisfying to know that even though he seemed like a golden boy with everything going for him when we were younger, he still managed to fuck up almost as bad as me,� said Vick, noting how good it felt to know that Morris, who was scouted by Division I football teams back when he was a high school quarterback, somehow never made it out of the slightly more affluent neighborhood of Glendale, where Vick also still lives. �I was so jealous of him growing up, but to see that he weighs only 10 or so pounds less than I do really puts my grudge to rest. And it�s pretty sad that he�s still dating Krista Kilmartin, the same old girl from high school, who by the way I was hopelessly in love with.� Vick reportedly felt smug after that Morris had taken a dead-end job as his manager at the local dollar store."
"After the pair turned down a social gathering for the third time that month, close friends of Dawn and Kevin Edmund confirmed Wednesday that the couple had really stopped being fun after having their kids die. �They never want to go out anymore; it�s always �We have family therapy� or �Dawn can�t get out of bed today� or whatever,� said Kevin�s best friend Thomas Fendrich, who added that in the years since the Edmunds� 4-year-old twin girls had been killed in a horrific car accident, it seemed like the couple no longer knew how to have a good time. �On the off chance they do come out, we�ll usually spend half of dinner looking at all of Dawn�s photos of her deceased kids, and it�s like, we get it! They were cute! And Kevin used to be such a party animal, but now he�s saying he can�t even look at alcohol after what happened. It�s honestly a bummer, and you know what? I can tell you right now that I�m not going to be one of those people who is just completely obsessed with their dead kids.� At press time, Fendrich was seen rolling his eyes as the couple launched into yet another boring story about their daughters� last words before passing away."
"Admitting that it was �a big step down� for a refined product such as itself to take the job in the first place, an artesian truffle oil confirmed Tuesday that it was deeply embarrassed to be working with low-class ingredients on loaded fries. �For years, I�ve been considered a delicacy, and now they just dump some runny sour cream all over me,� said the mortified infused oil, lamenting that it has found itself among �peasant foods� like ground beef, jalape�os, and bacon bits. �I don�t want to come off as elitist, but I have no business working as bar food. Not so long ago I was headlining Michelin-starred restaurants, and now they want to package me in a happy hour special with $3 Miller Lights? The cheek.� At press time, the truffle oil was objecting to its description in the menu as a �fixin.�"
"Admitting they were sorting through their heartbreak weeks after the tragedy, members of Sarpino family struggled to get through their first Christmas since their father returned, sources confirmed Tuesday. �Honestly, we�ve tried to just soldier through and enjoy what we can of baking cookies and putting on some Christmas music, but it�s hard to ignore how hollow all that is when we know that Howard is really here again,� said a tearful Claire Sarpino, 36, stressing that her husband�s presence was especially painful around this time of year, when there were so many festive symbols of the many happy memories the family had shared before his sudden and devastating reappearance. �God, last year�s Christmas was so relaxed and carefree. We took it for granted that those times without him would last forever. But now everywhere I look�from the shouting in the TV room to the six-pack in the fridge�I see reminders looming in the background. Frankly, I don�t know if we�ll ever put the pieces back together again.� At press time, Sarpino added that she was sure the family would get used to her husband being there eventually, but that their life would never quite feel the same."
"Shaking his head in stunned wonderment at all he had attained despite his many failings, 32-year-old Greg Langley told reporters Thursday that he still could not believe that he was no longer a virgin. �It�s been more than a decade since I first slept with a woman, and I still can�t fathom how or why that could have possibly happened,� said the deflowered network engineer, who marveled at the fact that a woman had somehow found him�a scrawny man with virtually no redeeming physical or intellectual traits�to be a worthy partner for sexual intercourse. �It just doesn�t make sense. Every time I think about that night, I think to myself, �No, Greg, that must have been a beautiful dream you had. You�re still the same old virgin you were way back in 2008.� But the thing is that it wasn�t a dream. I really had sex with a woman. It�s absolutely stunning.� Langley emphasized that paying for the evening in no way diminished his shock that it had happened at all."
"Noting that it had become way more noticeable in her hips and chin lately, local body-positive male ally Jason Isakson was reportedly worried Thursday that his girlfriend has been packing on the beauty lately. �Ashley has been really stressed out recently, and I fear that there may be more of her to worship than ever,� said the forward-thinking champion of female empowerment, explaining that he had noticed her 5- or 10-pound previous fluctuations in beauty, but that he had never seen her flawlessness get this bad before. �I don�t mind a little bit of extra gorgeous, but at some point, it�s a health thing. Her waist has gotten way more perfect the way it is for sure. I think she�s almost two sizes more stunning than she was in the summer.� At press time, Isakson was expressing concern to a neighbor that a nearby affordable housing development might attract too many people deserving of equal rights to the area."
"Revealing that not a single favorable attribute had emerged organically from his own personality, all of area man Spencer Lindell�s positive qualities were stolen from past friends, sources confirmed Tuesday. �I legitimately don�t think there�s a single good characteristic Spencer has that he didn�t pluck straight from one of his much more likable friends,� said longtime acquaintance Jeremy Lester, pointing out that Lindell had no interest in baking or running marathons until he noticed his popular junior year roommate partaking in such activities. �Everything from his haircut to his love of �80s synth pop to his sense of humor to his charming mannerisms and taste in movies can be directly traced back to someone else he used to know. Honestly, I�m convinced he�s just a roaring void that�s plastered over with these affectations to give the illusion of personhood. He�s just an empty vessel for other people�s better, more interesting traits.� At press time, it was confirmed that all of Lindell�s negative qualities, however, were totally his own."
"Holding his hand over the USB port implanted below his left ear, local Luddite Thomas Berkshire reportedly refused to merge consciousness Tuesday with his new self-driving 2070 Hyundai Elantra. �Uh oh, big scary technology is gonna steal Thomas�s very essence if he plugs in his brain stem to the car�s artificial neural network,� said friend Danny Perez, explaining how annoying it is to listen to the self-described technophobe constantly rant about the dangers of handing over his human autonomy to unthinking, barely regulated AI systems. �Thomas needs to stop fighting progress and realize that mentally fusing with our vehicles actually makes work more efficient. The singularity has vastly improved the quality of all our lives because once you�re integrated with the computer, you don�t require food or need to experience emotions. He�s so self-righteous about how he�s gonna drive his Hyundai Elantra instead of letting it drive him, but honestly, it just makes him sound like an old-fashioned sourpuss.� At press time, the Luddite�s consciousness was placed inside the county jail website after he was arrested for smashing an Amazon delivery bot."
"Stressing that he was both a pitiful excuse for masculinity and an utterly spineless little worm, reports confirmed Monday that Kevin Chinowski was a pathetic man who cries when upset rather than simply screaming at his 3-year-old son to shut the fuck up. �Jesus, what kind of shriveled husk of manhood lets himself tear up when he�s sad instead of yelling at his kid to knock it the hell off?� said sources close to Chinowski, adding that, when overwhelmed, the timid weakling was more likely to retreat to his bedroom and muffle his sobs in a pillow than lash out at his wife and son before smashing his plate into the trash in an impressive display of dominance. �It�s the sort of parenting that will just make his son grow up into another castrated wuss like him. Pretty soon, this kid is going to honestly believe that screaming obscenities at the top of your lungs and punching the wall until your knuckles are bloody isn�t the best way to deal with your anger. It�s a vicious goddamn cycle.� At press time, the effete male was spotted backing down to another father�s request that they let the children have a playdate at his house rather than beating the fellow parent to a pulp on the sidewalk to regain his status as an alpha male."
"In a stunning revelation that upended all expectations about her disposition, sources confirmed Friday that 34-year-old Katie Lorenz was not nearly as jovial or lighthearted as the pom-pom on her winter hat would appear to suggest. �When I first saw that fuzzy round tuft sprouting from her hat, I got really excited because I assumed she was a free spirit like me�but it seems this particular dash of whimsy belies a deep seriousness in her nature,� said local man Ryan Sykes, who described how the initial enthusiasm he felt as he rushed over to say hello was quickly undercut by the woman�s sudden confusion and blank stare. �I smiled, pointing to her fun hat and then to my fun, bright-colored socks, but her only response was to say, �Do I know you?� I have to be honest, if she�s not the spontaneous and quirky kind of woman the pom-pom would make you think she is, then wearing that hat is awfully misleading on her part.� At press time, Sykes had reportedly perked up again after noticing the sequins on Lorenz�s mittens."
"Prancing into the office like he didn�t just drink eight beers and something called the �Santa�s special� the very night before, sources confirmed Friday that their hungover coworker Justin Davis was a little too functional the morning after their company�s holiday party not to be an alcoholic. �Just eight hours ago, I saw Justin slam a couple shots of tequila, and now, he�s showing up to work almost an hour early with donuts for everyone,� said officemate Alyssa Woolas, adding that Justin, who had visibly bloodshot eyes, a low, raspy voice, and no memory of how he got home last night, was somehow just as productive now as he was on a normal workday. �Look. I love Justin, and I had a really fun time drinking with him, but I woke up with a pounding headache, still wearing my clothes from the night before. For him to go to bed at 3 a.m., wake up at 7 a.m., and then take the stairs up to our sixth-floor office must mean this is a little too much of a regular thing.� At press time, office sources told reporters that after nearly 12 straight hours of partying, the reason Justin was so chipper was because he was still drunk."
"Stopping to take stock of himself and actually enjoy the fresh air, area man Michael Perez relaxed his overwhelming sense of anxiety for just a moment Thursday, giving a pack of coyotes the opening they had long been waiting for. According to sources, Perez had gone on the hike to blow off steam and finally found the willpower to let go of his punishing angst for a peaceful moment, a change in demeanor which was immediately sensed by a pack of vicious, hungry coyotes that decided now was the time to strike. Witnesses confirmed that Perez smiled and took a deep breath while un-tensing his muscles, losing the split second of awareness that would have allowed him to evade the approaching coyotes that had been following him around every day in the hopes he would let his guard down in just such a way. At press time, Perez was more relaxed than he had been in years after the coyotes finished devouring his stomach and intestines."
"With the celebration rapidly burning through the diminishing supply of cash that has kept the local business solvent, sources confirmed Wednesday the holiday party of Simmons Analytics has moved up the company�s bankruptcy timeline by more than four months. �You�ve worked hard all year, so we decided to really pull out the stops this time for our holiday party!� said CEO Josh Kilgore, welcoming employees of the company that has netted losses for 16 consecutive quarters to the party, which was held in a ballroom at the Hilton Seattle, featured a live band, included a lavish spread of haute cuisine, and consumed nearly a quarter of annual operating costs. �Be sure to take advantage of the open bar. Everything�s on us tonight, so [before you�re all unemployed, uninsured, and unable to pay your bills] let�s have some fun. Cheers, everybody!� At press time, Kilgore had informed attendees they were welcome to take home any remaining trays of food, which will reportedly be the closest the workers ever get to claiming their severance packages."
"Expressing pride at all she had accomplished before even glimpsing the noonday sun, 127-year-old town hag Maelga Vitterbach admitted Wednesday that she was getting in a pretty good day of shaking a jangly bell-covered stick while pointing and screaming �You will die.� �Some days, it can be hard to even start jangling this knobby stick at villagers in the market square while screeching about their impending doom, but I think things are going really well so far,� said the carbuncle-covered shrew, adding that it wasn�t every day that she had the opportunity to both shriek at a comely lass that she was a cursed whore and pop up from behind a barrel to hurl a cat at a passing child. �Clearly, I started off strong when I pointed my crooked index finger at that strapping farmer and hissed that three sisters would visit his family tonight to take away the one he loved most. But to also be getting all this bell jangling in? This is fantastic.� Vitterbach added that the only way the day could get any better would be if she spent the night bedding a blacksmith while disguised as a young maiden, only to reveal her wizened, disfigured form just as he achieved climax to drag him down into hell for all eternity."
"Awestruck by a knowledge base spanning everything from 1960s art house films to the most recent episode of Veronica Mars, employees at SunTech Systems confirmed Monday that coworker Mason George, 31, possesses the preternatural ability to have heard good things about whatever pop culture phenomenon is being discussed at any given time. �Whether it�s a podcast he read something about or a movie a friend of his saw, Mason is always aware that it�s generally well-received,� said colleague Becca Thompson, recalling the dozen or so times George authoritatively delivered secondhand knowledge of superficial approval for some form of media, confirming to all who would listen that the movie, series, album, or artist in question had a lot of great buzz and was something he wished to check out sometime soon. �Even if we�re standing several dozen yards away from him and discussing a season of a TV show or a song, he unfailingly picks up on it and shares his experience of having read a capsule review of the thing we�re chatting about from all the way across the office. We were talking about Ocean�s 8 just last week and out of nowhere we heard him say he had seen a few clips of it online and thought it looked cool. It�s uncanny how anything and everything we�ve ever discussed is something he�s been meaning to watch. I can�t imagine where he finds the time.� George later became conspicuously absent from a lunchtime gathering in the SunTech break room when a discussion of the movie Last Christmas unexpectedly turned towards politics."
"Barely able to contain the slight approval on his face, local groom Brad Donnelly confirmed Friday that the sight of his beautiful bride walking down the aisle filled him with an overwhelming happyish feeling. �As soon as I saw her step out in her dress, I was overcome by this amazing above-neutral kind of sensation,� said Donnelly, admitting he had never felt so somewhat satisfied in his entire life. �Having all our friends and family here as the radiant love of my life came up to me, it was this amazing kind of sensation resembling joy. I never knew a person could feel so much like he should be generally pleased. I�m sure I�ll remember that moment for the rest of this weekend.� At press time, Donnelly was talking with his family about his sick grandfather who couldn�t make it and feeling confident this was the kind of thing that people feel sad about."
"Emphasizing that his house was perfectly fine to live in now and really didn�t need that many updates, local 32-year-old Jerry MacQuoid confirmed Friday that he didn�t want to put too much effort into fixing up a home he was just going to burn down for insurance fraud one day. �Sure, the floors are scuffed, and a lot of the fixtures are definitely from the eighties, but why would I sink all that time and money into improvements if I�m inevitably going to end up torching the place for a quick buck?� said MacQuoid, who added that while he saw the benefits of finishing the basement and putting in a new kitchen, hiring contractors and architects would ultimately just make his attempts to extort half a million dollars from his insurance company even more complicated. �Look�do I see myself raising my family in this house? No. I see us in a big two-story home in the suburbs, after I�ve burned this one to the ground, hired a lawyer, and sued everyone for all they�re worth. Might as well start dousing the place in kerosene sooner than later, right?� At press time, MacQuoid told reporters that he had actually decided to splurge on one upgrade, a new electrical panel which would both lower his utility bill and mysteriously explode on his next vacation."
"Writing off the behavior as common for his age, local mother Deenah Young told sources Thursday she was confident her 26-year-old son Devin�s psychological abuse of all the women he had ever dated was simply a phase that would end when he met the right girl. �I know it�s a little silly for Dev to still be leveraging sociopathic levels of misogyny toward every member of the female gender, but he�s just waiting for that special someone,� said Young, who expressed complete assurance that once he really fell in love, her son would cease the decades-long pattern in which he has engaged in the emotional manipulation, vicious ridicule, and ultimate abandonment of every woman he has dated. �Sometimes the right one has to come along before a boy will stop barraging girlfriends with constant comments about their weight, or hang up those youthful desires to isolate a woman from her friends and family in order to take advantage of her. Devin�s having his fun, but mark my words, before he hits 30, he�ll get tired and settle down. Then he won�t spend all his time maliciously destroying his partner�s confidence just to prop up his own anymore. And who knows? Maybe there�s a girl out there who will find his constant oscillation between manipulative isolation and suffocating neediness endearing.� Reports later confirmed Young couldn�t help but chuckle and shake her head at her son�s hijinks after hearing yet another girlfriend had filed a restraining order against him."
"Shedding new light on just how happy life could have been if things had worked out a little differently, a new report published Wednesday has concluded that it sure would�ve been nice if Dad had loved his original family as much as his second one. �You can really see he�s an empathetic person who takes a genuine interest in these kids, and it�s amazing to think about what it would have been like to have had some of that back when we were children,� sources are quoted as saying in the report, which noted just how cool it would have been if the kindness Dad showed toward his current wife at Thanksgiving dinner had been applied to Mom even once over the 12-year span of their marriage. �It�s touching to watch him spend time nurturing the talents and hobbies of his new kids, but I don�t think he even knows what I do for work. He also named his new son after himself, something he didn�t bother doing when my brother and I were born more than 20 years ago. I don�t think he even helped pick our names.� The report went on to state it also would�ve been nice if Dad hadn�t asked sources to get out of a second photo taken over the holiday so he could have one with just his new family."
"Yanking the girl into the grocery store to avoid further embarrassment, local mom Tara Cochran scolded her daughter Wednesday for pointing at a homeless man instead of ignoring his very existence. �Sophia, no. We do not acknowledge a homeless person�s humanity, it�s impolite,� said Cochran, quietly admonishing her daughter�s rudeness while avoiding eye contact with the man sitting on a dirty piece of cardboard begging for change. �You�re going to make him feel bad instead of making him feel invisible. We need to be respectful of these people by treating them as objects blocking the sidewalk. If they talk to you first, then it�s ok to shake your head and murmur �Sorry, can�t help,� but otherwise, leave them in destitute peace. Yes, even if you have some change, you shouldn�t go giving it to them because that�s wrong.� Cochran went on to explain to her daughter why it�s important to tell the Salvation Army bell-ringer that you just donated, even if you didn�t."
"Saying he sleepwalks through life until the next opportunity arises to savor tangy, slow-cooked meats, sources confirmed Tuesday local man Evan Demers spends his days occasionally eating barbecue in between doing things he hates. �He works really long hours at a job he despises, constantly complains about his family, and doesn�t even seem to enjoy being around his friends�to be honest, the only time I�ve seen him satisfied is when there happens to be a slab of short ribs or a pulled pork sandwich in front of him,� longtime Demers acquaintance Russ Perkins said of the man who reportedly exists in a state of continuous irritability that is only interrupted at random intervals when, for a brief period, he is actively biting or chewing such food items as brisket, smoked chicken, baked beans, or cornbread. �You can tell he�s just going through the motions of life and is pretty miserable. He did seem to snap out of it a little when that new barbecue place opened near his house a couple years back. It closed after a few months, though.� At press time, reports stated that Demers was staring at an empty plate, licking the remnants of a vinegar-based sauce from his thumb, and trying to summon enough motivation to load the dishwasher."
"Revealing elevated tensions in the group, washboard player Jimmy Phelps confirmed Tuesday that he was tired of his jug band�s spoons guy getting all the chicks. �I do a lot of leg work setting the tone for the whole show, yet the ladies are all over that jackass,� said Phelps, watching with envy as female fans rushed to get photos and autographs from the self-confident spoons player. �What an arrogant prick walking up on stage in his flashy overalls and straw hat and showboating like that. I mean, obviously, the jug guy is going to get some attention because he�s the leader, but the spoons guy? Really? They�re a dime a dozen. It�s actually really hard to find a quality washboard player these days. Besides, I joined Colonel Pillbox�s Jug Band & Company way before he did, so it�s only fair I get some acknowledgment.� At press time, Phelps decided to drown his loneliness and heartache in bathtub gin."
"Lauding the children�s series� overall quality and specifically noting its commitment to comprehensive world-building, local stay-at-home dad Judd Teudel, who remarked Tuesday that he personally found Team Umizoomi �actually kind of interesting,� was reportedly on the verge of a complete psychotic breakdown. �There�s a surprising amount of depth to the characters,� said Teudel, who has repeatedly struggled with exhaustion and intense feelings of aggravation while providing care for his toddler son. �I never really gave it a chance until recently, but it�s more than just a bunch of kid stuff. There are subtle elements to the storytelling that most kids probably wouldn�t understand, seriously catchy songs, brief reflections of inner desolation, hidden ruminations on estrangement from one�s family and those once so-called friends, and even a surprising wry quality in the way they teach you to, like, measure things. It�s definitely not Paw Patrol, because they actually care about character development, and it doesn�t mock me and everything I once dreamed about like that little shit Caillou.� A bleary-eyed Foster was later seen explaining the serialized nature of the later seasons to his wife after she caught him browsing a Team Umizoomi message board."
"Stressing that the part-time administrative assistant should book a flight as soon as possible, sources confirmed this week that all of 28-year-old Hailey Allen�s problems stem from her never having visited Europe. �All her relationship hang-ups, low self-esteem, and failures at work would immediately disappear if Hailey finally experienced the grandeur of the La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona or tossed a coin into the Trevi Fountain in Rome,� said concerned sources, noting that every single one of Allen�s professional and personal issues could be resolved with even just a weekend spent exploring the streets of Paris. �The moment she bites down into a Parisian pain au chocolat at a caf�, she�ll immediately transcend her current self, becoming a fully matured, well-rounded, and happy person. To clarify, this is only applicable for Western European countries and does not include Asia, Russia, or any nation East of the Baltic Sea.� At press time, sources panicked as Allen was seen purchasing a Greyhound ticket for Warsaw, IN."
"Touching on the immediate emotional connection he shared with the piece of poultry, 4-year-old Kyle Wright reportedly decided to become a vegetarian Thursday after forming a close friendship with a roasted turkey leg. �Gosh, I can�t believe I ever thought of eating a friendly little guy like Harry,� said Wright, who hugged the recently named drumstick close to his chest as he explained that his choice of vegetarianism came about after hearing his mother explain that the turkey legs they eat at the dinner table were no different from the one he had spent the past week cuddling with before bedtime and walking around the yard with a leash. �It never crossed my mind before. But the longer I spend with him and his cute knobby foot, the more I get that he has feelings and dreams just the same as me. Sure, he�s a little shy, but why would I ever want to hurt my best pal?� At press time, Wright was visibly horrified after kissing the turkey leg and finding his crispy, salt-brined skin irresistibly delicious."
"After two hours in which they discussed a variety of routine topics with waning enthusiasm, the local Halverson family�s Thanksgiving conversation reportedly devolved this afternoon into simple observations about what their dog was currently doing. �Hey, look at him now,� Jason Halverson said as Bailey, a 13-year-old golden retriever, shuffled from the kitchen into the living room and elicited multiple comments from the relatives, who sources confirmed had exhausted their usual observations about work, school, and holiday traffic. �Bailey sure seems to love that chew toy. He hasn�t dropped it since Ruth and Hank got here. He�s really wagging that tail. And now he�s just staring out the window. What does he see out there? Oh, look, the tired little guy is curled up on the sofa to take a little nap!� At press time, the Halverson family�s Thanksgiving conversation had reportedly devolved into speculations upon what their dog was currently dreaming about."
"The owner of a new sip-and-weld studio revealed that the workshop will provide guests the opportunity to casually drink wine while creating their very own blowtorched masterpiece, sources confirmed Wednesday. �You bring the cabernet, we�ll supply the arc welders, oxy-acetylene torches, face shields, and metalworking gloves,� said owner Kimberly Solis, adding that classes are open to all skill levels from people who have never held a soldering iron to experienced journeymen. �Kick your bachelorette parties or date nights up a notch by drinking and welding along with an instructor or feel free to express yourself by blowtorching your very own robot or yard sculpture. While you�re splitting a bottle of wine with your pals, you�ll also learn how to fuse together nuts, bolts, pipes, wires, and sheet iron into a unique piece of art. But more importantly, you�ll be bonding with your friends while you bond metal at over 2,000-degree Fahrenheit.� Solis added that the studio is also available to host children�s birthdays."
"Visibly annoyed after his auction closed with a winning bid far below his expectations, actor Matt Damon begrudgingly accepted $50 Monday from the eBay auction of his cast and crew jacket from the sci-fi thriller The Martian. �I sort of don�t want to part with my only memento from my time on that set, but I really need the cash,� said Damon, noting that other than a grape fruit juice stain on its left sleeve, the jacket was in near-mint condition and should sell for �way more� given its connection to a real Hollywood movie. �I had assumed there would be a bidding war or something, but almost no one bit. And I was banking on using the cash from this to cover my acting classes. As it is, I�m actually losing a little money on the whole thing. I should have never agreed to pay shipping on this.� Damon�s mood reportedly changed to anger after learning the person who bought the jacket resold the item in two days later for $475."
"Looking for honest feedback on the latest addition to her wardrobe, local 27-year-old Molly Hanson reportedly asked her panicking boyfriend �Does this look good?� while wearing a new Big Bird outfit. �I spent a little more than I usually do, but I really think it compliments my figure,� said Hanson, as she spun around for her stammering, sweat-covered boyfriend of six months, giving him a full view of the bright yellow plumage, ribbed pink-and-orange leggings, and 8-inch beak she had purchased earlier that afternoon. �Does it look flattering? I haven�t taken the tag off yet, so if you totally hate it, I can still return it and get my $200 back. The important thing is that you like it.� At press time, after 15 minutes of stumbling over his words, Hanson�s boyfriend admitted the outfit went great with her eyes despite his disappointment that it wasn�t Oscar the Grouch."
"Dubbing the new head chef of Michelin-starred restaurant The Haymarket as �the new bad boy of fine dining,� luminaries across the world of cooking lauded Andre Castillo Monday for revolutionizing the culinary arts by using only fresh, high-quality ingredients in his dishes. �When he declared that from the beginning of his tenure we would only make our food with the finest local meats and produce grown by people who cared, we were naturally confused,� said sous chef Raymond Fiorna, who struggled early on as Castillo�s iconoclastic method of using fresh meat, produce, and spices butted heads with the conventional wisdom of creating dishes with preserved meats, frozen vegetables, and seafood from places so far away from the restaurant that they took a long time to arrive. �Diners expected us to just conduct business as usual and go to a factory farm or discount supermarket for our ingredients, but Andre said it was time to evolve. He once brought me a room-temperature head of kale to chop, and when I asked him which freezer he got it from, you know what he told me? It came from a local organic farm. From a farm, then straight to the table! Lunacy, absolute madness, but somehow it works. I expect this will soon be a worldwide phenomenon.� Castillo has also been praised and derided in equal turn for changing the gastronomic game again by taking a classic dish and putting his own little twist on it."
"Claiming that he should get one if his sibling did, local child Noah Weiss reportedly wondered Friday why his older brother was the only one to get a funeral. �How come Brendan gets a funeral, but I don�t?� said Weiss, explaining that it wasn�t fair that his older brother got a cool casket that he could lay down in while he had to walk around in an uncomfortable, itchy suit and talk to people he didn�t know. �Everyone�s talking about how much they love him, and no one is even saying anything nice about me. And why are his pictures the only ones put up around the church and not mine? He gets all the attention.� At press time, Weiss was throwing a tantrum after finding out his brother didn�t have to go to school anymore."
"Expressing frustration with the constant interruptions, veterinarian Dr. Kate Ludlow wished Friday that the overbearing owner of Bella the pug would let the dog answer one goddamn question. �Christ, I�m trying to get information from Bella about why she�s come in today and her owner keeps butting in before she even has a chance to respond,� said Ludlow, adding that she realized that the appointment would be exasperating when she offered the 14-pound pug a treat and her pushy owner piped up too say Bella probably wouldn�t eat it because she�s nervous about being at the vet. �It�s like, hello, I�m talking to the patient, but you�re not letting her get a word in edgewise. Who do you think knows better about whether her paw hurts, you or the limping dog? I might just send her to the waiting room so I can talk candidly with Bella without having to hear her idiotic opinions on what�s wrong.� At press time, Ludlow was incensed after the dog�s owner insisted she be given Bella�s medication so she could dose it out herself.�"
"Voluntarily surrendering the remarkable talent that gave her profound insight into the true nature of existence, the only person with the ability to see the world for what it actually is has started taking antidepressants, sources confirmed Thursday. Like a divine seer who blinds herself rather than face the overwhelming light of truth, Ingrid Pearson�the 28-year-old account manager and sole individual capable of seeing through the facade of joy and meaning human beings project upon their lives�reportedly relinquished her unmatched perceptivity by filling a prescription for Zoloft from her primary care physician. According to sources, Pearson had carried the burden of her vast wisdom from her teenage years up until this week, when the daily 50 milligram dose of her medication began to correct for her brain�s serotonin deficiency. At press time, accounts confirmed Pearson had already capitulated to the cosmic farce of humanity by enjoying a night out with friends instead of brooding over the cold and vast nothingness of the universe."
"Frantically scanning the rug below her web, a panicked local spider confirmed Monday that she had completely lost track of a human she had noticed scurrying across the floor. �Oh, God. Where is that thing? I looked away for one second and it disappeared,� said the spider, searching along the baseboards near the couch where she last saw the human sitting before it seemingly vanished into thin air. �I didn�t even see it at first because it blended in against the walls, but then it leaned forward and picked up a magazine. Ugh, it�s a hairy one, and they always move so much faster than you think they will. Ew, ew, ew. If I find him again, I�ll definitely have to bite it.� At press time, the horrified spider called for her husband after discovering dozens of humans scuttling in through the front door for a party."
"With student-to-teacher ratios beginning to approach a more manageable level, sources confirmed Friday that a highly infectious strain of the flu sweeping through Washington Middle School this month has reduced class sizes to the point that learning is now feasible. �With this terrible illness forcing so many of our kids to stay home, I can actually give the students who remain some of the individualized attention they deserve,� said American history teacher Gina Wright, who along with her colleagues reported finally being able to meet some of the basic educational needs of her pupils now that a devastating virus has infected more than 300 of the school�s children. �Our classes are still overcrowded, but if a few more kids go down, it may, for the first time, be possible to implement a truly adequate curriculum. I�m sure we could have caught the outbreak earlier if we were able to afford school nurses. To be honest, though, this is a pretty nice trade-off.� Wright went on to predict that a new round of cuts to the school lunch program would likely weaken student health and keep class sizes small as more children are sickened."
"Saying it would be silly not to take advantage of such great deals, 31-year-old computer programmer Jared Hermann confirmed Thursday he had stopped by a local Walgreens to load up on clearance sale of Armistice Day candy. �It�s my little annual tradition to hit up the stores once Nov. 12 rolls around, because that�s when they�ve got all the good stuff priced to move,� Hermann said as he showed off his haul of Armistice Day favorites such as Mary Jane taffy, sassafras drops, and clove-flavored chewing gum, treats that were selling for three times as much just a week ago, as people prepared to celebrate the 1918 cessation of hostilities on the Western Front. �Sometimes, I can�t believe how much you can get for just a few bucks, but I picked up a bunch of the Reese�s Armistice Day chocolate memorial wreaths, as well as a couple bags of Liberty chews, which is of course what we Americans called Germany�s Haribo gummy bears during World War I. I�ll probably sneak a few when I get home, but I�m going to save most of these for next year.� Hermann told reporters he also planned to check out the sales at local costume stores, explaining that he hopes to dress up as an assassinated Archduke Ferdinand for Armistice Day next year."
"Admitting that it was a learned tactic more than a genuine expression of love, area woman Callie Garrett told reporters Thursday that she knew her husband was just displaying affection because he was hungry. �Oh, it�s so sweet when he runs towards me and starts nuzzling and making little happy noises, even if I really know it�s only because he wants me to feed him,� said Garrett, noting that despite her husband�s motives, she enjoyed the few minutes the two of them spent together while he paced around the kitchen as she prepared his meal. �He�s usually pretty standoffish, hiding in some little corner of the house where I can�t even find him, but as soon as he hears that can opener start, he makes a beeline right towards me.� Garrett added that she was looking forward to the next time her husband decided to cuddle with her in bed, even if she knew it was only because he was cold.�"
"Insisting that the rapid-fire series of messages was �completely unprompted,� local man Matisse Issac speculated Thursday that his girlfriend, Rebecca Allen, must have been drinking when she texted him a dimly lit picture of a knitted scarf at midnight. �Jesus Christ, now she�s telling me to come over and knit with her. I have work in the morning,� said Issac, who nervously texted back �nice� in response to the garter-knit scarf in a desperate attempt to buy time to think of a proper response. �I can already see what happened here. She had a glass and a half of wine and just started knitting. She gets a little flirty when she�s drunk, and it�s not like I�m mad or anything, but I really don�t know what to say.� At press time, Ms. Allen had texted her boyfriend a winking face emoji to accompany the message �What are you reading right now?��"
"Stripped of his files and chair, police officer Mike McCarry was removed from desk duty and placed on empty-room duty Wednesday after brutally beating a drawer. �Effective immediately, Officer McCarry has been placed in an empty storage space off the main office bullpen while we investigate claims he viciously slammed a desk drawer until it shattered,� said Police Commissioner James O�Neill, refusing to take questions about McCarry�s work history, including the fact that he was placed on desk duty three months ago for allegedly shooting a black teenager during a routine traffic stop. �Our officer says he verbally ordered the drawer to open multiple times, which it refused to do before it suddenly sprang out of the desk without warning, spilling its contents onto the linoleum. Officer McCarry then subdued with drawer with force, first with a taser and then by placing his knee on its underside. Anti-police activists are claiming that surveillance video shows Officer McCarry bashing the drawer against the wall and kicking the compartment after it had broken in half, but I urge the public to withhold judgment because they have not seen the video in its entirety. We believe the facts will show he acted in good faith, and we expect him to be cleared of all wrongdoing.� At press time, McCarry was placed back on regular duty after heroically taking down the break room coffee maker that had burned his partner."
"In a stunning display of managerial skill that had sources speculating about the heights he would reach in the world of multinational commerce, a precocious 5-year-old was on Wednesday already holding long, pointless meetings with his stuffed animals. The administrative prodigy reportedly displayed complacency and a sense of self-importance wildly beyond his years as he rounded up plush monkeys, teddy bears, Elmo, and dozens of other toys, then made them sit in rows for multiple hours as he pontificated about a wildly impractical idea to build a wooden railroad across the kitchen floor that had just occurred to him that morning and which he hadn�t fleshed out in the slightest. Sources further confirmed that on multiple occasions, the boy modulated his voice to ask a question as one of the female elephant attending the meeting before cutting her off and repeating a less coherent version of the same idea as though he himself had just thought of it, showing off his preternatural gifts for micromanagement and wasting his subordinates� time as he distributed crayon-drawn pictures of his vague future expectations for playtime that he had already voiced numerous times before. The preschool-aged wunderkind then reportedly paused to take a heated call from an owl on his Vtech Kids Smartphone in front of the entire meeting, displaying a rare combination of natural thoughtlessness and quickness to anger that will serve him well as a corporate executive, before informing the assembled stuffed animals that he was very busy when his real plan was to sit on the couch and watch Sesame Street. At press time, the gifted 5-year-old had cemented his place among the nation�s future business leaders by reaming out a push penguin for poor job performance in front of everyone and telling it that it had better be off the premises by snack time."
"Seizing a rare opportunity to finally enjoy lunch without distracting her coworkers, Cranston & Digby copywriter Jeanine Mitchell took advantage of the moment Wednesday when the sudden crack of gunfire in the office provided her with the auditory cover she needed to bite into a crisp Kiku apple. �What great timing,� said Mitchell, relishing the apple�s sharp autumnal taste and firm texture in quiet isolation as her shrieking coworkers were mowed down in a thunderous fusillade and blessing her luck that everyone else in the open-plan office was too distracted by masked assailants to notice the juice that dribbled onto her shirt. �[Manager] Kevin [Gunderson] is always getting on my case about me eating at my desk, so it�s fortunate that I got a few bites in before successive direct hits to his cranium turned his head my way. Plus, it sounds like they�re using fully automatic weapons over in the art department, so I�ll be able to get through my baby carrots if I hurry.� Mitchell later stated that she was �unable to believe her good fortune� when a responding SWAT team evacuated the office, allowing her to throw away the apple core without any of the survivors noticing."
"Expressing frustration with his roommate�s apparent lack of hygiene and off-putting habits, college freshman Kyle Hayes told reporters Tuesday that he was annoyed about having to room with Isaac Feldman, a 47-year-old adjunct professor at the University of Maine. �He�s always hitting me up for money and meal swipes, but my plan doesn�t really cover that,� said Hayes, adding that his roommate also tended to do these �weird exercises� in their living area to help with the back problem he developed in his early 40s. �Anytime I try to have people over, Isaac is always on my case about quieting down because he needs to stay up late grading papers about Heidegger or something. But he seems to have no problem covering his desk with empty ramen containers and pages from his doctoral thesis. Plus, he�s definitely been drinking my milk. I tried to talk to him about not going into my mini-fridge, but he�s always rushing out the door to pick up his daughter from his ex�s. Man, this whole situation sucks.� Hayes went on to stress that he would probably ask to switch to a different dorm if his roommate kept insisting that he be referred to as Dr. Feldman in conversation."
"Quietly discussing whether the canine needed some kind of psychological help, members of the Elk Creek wolf pack were worried Tuesday that a young member might be a sociopath after he heartlessly mauled a defenseless rabbit. �It�s really unnerving, he just ripped apart that poor thing without any remorse,� said pack leader Blackcoat the Windrunner, who expressed concerns that this was just the latest in a long line of unnerving incidents including biting his younger sister and stalking around in the dead of night trying to catch mice. �I don�t even think he realized how disgusting this was, I mean he tore its leg off when it was still alive. We hoped he was just a little awkward, but this is terrifying. Unfortunately, this is exactly how his father started before we kicked him out of the pack.� At press time, Blackcoat had been banished from the pack after the young wolf went behind his back and convinced the other members that he was secretly plotting against them."
"Referring to the Emmy-winning actor as �a real family man,� mother of three Janet Jeune casually rattled off the names and ages of Alec Baldwin�s children during the course of mundane conversation Monday. �His eldest daughter, Ireland, from his first marriage with that one actress, just turned 24,� Jeune said wholly unprompted and unprovoked while watching a broadcast of It�s Complicated. �His sons are 1, 3, and 4 years old. Rafael is probably about to start kindergarten soon. Oh, and he has a 6-year-old daughter with his second wife.� Jeune�s sons confirmed that their mother continued to recall rumors about Ireland�s dating life long after her children had left the room."
"Confirming no one had raised the subject of drinking, coworkers of newly expectant mother Jennifer Guest reported that after the brand consultant announced her pregnancy to the office Monday, she had been a bit too quick to mention she was still allowed to have a weekly glass of wine. �She had barely gotten out that she was having a baby before she was, like, �I can still have wine, though!�� said Bridgemeyer Marketing Services secretary Sharon Wilson, recalling how Guest had reiterated several times that it was a normal thing to do while pregnant and had gotten progressively more defensive despite the fact that no one was disagreeing with her. �Before we could even congratulate her, she was going into detail about how it was a great way for pregnant women to wind down at the end of the week, and that it wasn�t like a drink or even two was going to hurt the baby. It got uncomfortable at one point, because she started citing a bunch of studies, complete with all these complicated statistics, and everyone was just kind of nodding in silence. Thankfully, [operations manager] Frank [Searle] said he had read somewhere that red wine was good for your heart, and that took the heat off her for a while.� At press time, attendees at a company happy hour said that while Guest had ordered only one 6-ounce glass of chardonnay that evening, she had been a little too wholehearted in her enjoyment of it."
"Fully aware that the issue could cause tension and conflict for his family, recently divorced dad Frank Harrison confirmed Friday that he was waiting for the right time to introduce his children to the woman he hooked up with last night. �The divorce was just finalized last week, and they tell you not to rush into anything, so that�s why I�m thinking 10 or 11 a.m. would be okay,� said Harrison, noting that while there�s no perfect time to find out your father banged a complete stranger, holding off until after Aiden and Rebecca had eaten breakfast could help ease the news. �We�ve been together for almost 10 hours at this point, so I feel like waiting any longer could make things weird. You only get to make a first impression once, and I want to make sure they hit it off. I was pretty drunk last night, but from what I can remember, she seems like a really great lady.� At press time, Harrison breathed a sigh of relief after discovering the woman had snuck out in the middle of the night."
"Hoping to pick up a few tips on �maximizing his creative toolkit,� local poet Ian Kelly, 31, was reportedly watching a video about the habits of effective artists Thursday so that he, too, could be an effective artist. �These tips are what the best of the best do, practices that the leading artistic minds perform every day,� said Kelly, who jotted down a few notes from the seven-minute-long YouTube video stressing the importance of discipline and integrity as an artist looking to build a legacy of transparency and innovation. �It�s pretty inspiring to think that I could be just like Pablo Neruda if I only set efficient goals and get feedback. Oh, and that�s interesting about Beethoven. I hope that I, too, can achieve that reach. Huh, I wonder what Da Vinci watched to become so effective? Probably a play or a puppet show.� At press time, Kelly had left the video behind after clicking on an ad from MasterClass."
"Remarking that it seemed as though she was intentionally twisting the meaning of his words, an audience participant at a drag brunch Thursday confirmed that he felt like the performer was deliberately misconstruing his responses to her questions. �When I first mentioned that I was a plumber and she said that she had some holes she�d like me to plug, I of course assumed I wasn�t being clear in my remarks, but as the interview progressed, I began to suspect she was being willfully obtuse in interpreting my answers,� said attendee Jake Shoals, 38, detailing how his straightforward comment about the bottomless mimosa special had been distorted into a suggestion that he would enjoy seeing women without their skirts on, which was reportedly not his intention at all. �Now, she�s asking me if I prefer my eggs done over easy, which seems like an innocuous enough question, but I�m frankly afraid to answer!� Shoals added that he hadn�t been this flabbergasted since a stand-up comedian had persisted in suggesting his girlfriend of five years was a sex worker despite any evidence to suggest such a thing."
"Stating that it would just take a minute and it would be way easier with two people, a new report released Wednesday revealed that local man Greg Metcalf just needed a little help here. �If you could just pop over here and grab the other end that would be great,� said the report, confirming this wasn�t actually that heavy, it was just awkward. �Buddy, come on. Stop staring and get over here. It�s only one flight of stairs and then we�re done. Just give me a hand, okay? This thing was expensive.� At press time, Metcalf told reporters that �fuck it� he could just do it himself."
"In an attempt to extricate himself from the moribund lifestyle of his rural town, Catholic priest Father James Callahan found himself seriously considering child molestation this week as a possible avenue of being transferred to a different parish. �There�s just nothing interesting going on here, and while I�d welcome the chance to relocate, I don�t want to wait the usual five years, so I figure I�ll be accused of something with an altar boy and be packing my bags in no time,� said Callahan, who normally has no sexual predilections towards children, but after submitting several fruitless requests for transfer, decided on what he believed was the quickest way to get himself placed in a more sophisticated, urban environment. �The nearest city to here is Dayton and that�s still half an hour away, so I�m kind of going up the walls here. I�d love to end up somewhere where you can get decent sushi, but honestly, even going someplace warm for the winter would be worth being involved with a congregant�s child.� Callahan later elaborated that if he eventually got bored at the new parish, he could most likely keep on molesting kids until he was posted to a sweet gig in Rome."
"Seeking to showcase his pride for his comrades� heroism, hardline pastry chef Dave Southerton had reportedly displayed a black-and-white American flag with a raspberry cream stripe Tuesday to honor the sacrifices bakers make every day. �My profession is constantly under attack nowadays by people who claim we�re overusing confectioners sugar or that we�re trigger happy with our piping guns, but until you�ve been in our kitchens and had to make a snap judgment about when to take the cake out of the oven, you�ll never understand what it�s like,� said Southerton, telling reporters that the flag symbolized that he was part of the �thin meringue line� that separates order from chaos. �It�s easy for people to accuse my brave bakers-in-arms for their use of extreme flavors and nitpick a few bad apple turnovers. They might feel different if they ever had to experience the fear of walking through an unlit pantry at 3 a.m., only to discover the flour got all clumped together. I hope no civilian ever has to experience that, but maybe before you knock the toque and apron, you should think about the fact that when I leave the house every morning, I don�t know if I�ll be coming home that day covered in red velvet.� When asked about the numerous high-profile news stories where nut allergy sufferers died after receiving cake against their will, Southerton claimed this was an unfortunate but necessary consequence of serving the community. "
"Noting his evident reluctance to break eye contact with the steadily rotating tupperware container, employees at Vizer Solutions speculated Tuesday that coworker Edward Morris was apparently just going to stare at his lunch in the microwave for the entire three-minute cook time. �Man, I guess his plan is to just stand a few feet off and peer at his food until the timer finally goes off,� said employee Patricia Clarke, noting that the visibly exhausted Morris had not moved once, even when a coworker was forced to squeeze past him to use the tea drawer, instead opting to stand his ground and maintain an intense direct line of sight with his meal. �It�s just ziti, too. No one is going to steal it, and there�s no chance that he�ll overcook it. God, he looks so determined, though.� At press time, Morris had continued to stare intently at his meal for 30 full seconds after the timer went off before sighing deeply and finally removing it from the microwave."
"Bemoaning his inability to prioritize actual responsibilities over online distractions, local man Harper Crawford reportedly spent hours surfing the internet Monday rather than dealing with real pressing issues piling up in Harvest Moon: Light of Hope. �Here I am reading through my friend�s Facebook page like any of this stuff matters, when I know for a fact that I have an entire harbor town depending on me to rebuild their businesses and fix the local lighthouse,� said Crawford, stressing that while there were few real-world repercussions if he were to exit his browser and log off of his computer, there were numerous people, including Soleil, Gus, and the rest of the farming simulator�s characters, who counted on his daily commitment to putting in the hard work of picking up his watering can and going out into the field to harvest his turnips. �The worst part is that even as I�m mindlessly scrolling through Reddit, I have this nagging sense that there are mutated strains of Angel Lantern building up out on my farm. For Christ�s sake, this island is the place I call home. What am I doing wasting my time responding to work emails?� Crawford also admitted that while he, of course, should spend some time in Harvest Moon�s Dog Racing Festival, he knew that all of this was ultimately just sidetracking him from the core issue of unlocking the Botanist skill set in Stardew Valley."
"In a report that shed new light into �How to really get this party going,� wedding guest Melissa Ramirez confirmed Friday that it was going to take a lot more than �Love Shack� to bring her out to the dance floor. �If you think dropping a silly little song like �Love Shack� is going to make people leap out of their seats, then you�ve got another thing coming,� said Ramirez, who noted that the DJ was going to have to bring his A game if he thought middling tracks like �We Are Family� or �Tainted Love� would cut it. �It�s got to be faster. It�s got to be louder. And it�s got to be something choreographed. Look at these poor people now, they can�t dance to this. They�re just kind of standing there shimmying. I�m not getting out there for anything less than the �Cha-Cha Slide.�� At press time, Ramirez was shaking her head as her entire table jumped to their feet upon hearing the opening bars of �I Want You Back.�"
"Searching for anything bearing even a passing resemblance to a normal beverage, junior broker Eric Voss, 34, was observed scanning the menu at The Crow�s Nest, an upscale cocktail bar, for whichever drink included the fewest unfamiliar ingredients. �Elderflower? That�s definitely out, and this one seems to be mostly whiskey, but God only knows what gomme syrup is supposed to be,� said Voss, visibly attempting to remain composed in front of his date as he paged through a leather-bound menu of inscrutable infusions, obscure tropical fruits, and entire phrases in French. �This one with watermelon looked good at first, but there are maybe six other things listed after that I�ve never heard of. Most of these are probably types of bitters, right? Or liqouers, maybe? Egg white, no. Gelatin, no. Here we go, they�ve got an old fashioned, so we�ve got brandy, citrus...christ, what the hell is �fat-washed� liquor?� At press time, Voss was watching with mounting apprehension as the bartender lit the rum and Coke he had ordered on fire and reached for a durian fruit."
"Springing out of his characteristic ennui immediately upon hearing the knock at the restroom�s door, local man Ethan Finney reportedly announced, �Someone�s in here,� Friday at Sunflower Caf� in the first real assertion of his own existence in months. �One second! I�m in here!� said Finne, affirming the physical reality of his own being in a manner he had habitually avoided for the past three months, before going on to suggest that his place in the universe possessed purpose, meaning, and value that demanded others acknowledge his presence as a living being with emotions and sentience. �I�ll be out soon! Can you just wait? [I am real. I am present. I exist. Please, you have to understand. I am real. See me. Just see that I exist.]� At press time, Finney was spotted apologizing for taking so long as he hurried out of the bathroom in a reversion to the wraithlike state of sheer self-effacement that has defined nearly all of his adult life."
"Saying he was unwilling to take any chances with his safety, local man Jay Tierney confirmed Thursday that he made sure to ask every trick-or-treater if they�re the real Dracula, just in case. �Obviously, Halloween can be a lot of fun, but if you show up at my doorstep with fangs and a cape, I�m gonna need some answers in case I need to defend myself,� said Tierney, adding that, as a precaution, he kept a wooden stake and mallet behind the front door. �Usually, they say �No� and I can just play it off like a joke, but better safe than sorry. I don�t want to end up a vampire myself, cursed to walk the night and feast on the blood of the innocent just because I was too embarrassed to ask a simple question. If a trick-or-treater ever does admit he�s Dracula, I�ll probably throw a Snickers in the yard and then lock the door while he�s picking it up.� At press time, Tierny peeked from behind a curtain as several costumed teens, among them possibly a real zombie and the actual Darth Vader, egged his house."
"Inhaling deeply while suppressing the horror of what he witnessed earlier that day, exterminator Paul Young took a moment Tuesday to compose himself in the driveway so that his kids would not have to deal with the fact that he witnessed the death of a cricket at work. �This is my burden to bear, not theirs,� said Young, attempting to banish images of the cricket�s twitching body and finals moments on Earth from his mind before sitting down to dinner with the wife and kids who, Young hoped, would not notice their father�s brittle temperament. �I really lost it and yelled at my son for something like 10 minutes straight the other day, but I know I did it from fear of losing little Jalen just like that cricket. Every time I look into his eyes, I can�t help but see it, legs scrabbling in the air, body twitching, fast at first, then more slowly, then�nothing. Just nothing. God, I�ve got to figure out a way to not bring this home with me.� Young�s son was later spotted sneaking halfway down the stairs in the middle of the night and sitting there listening intently as his father sobbed quietly in the living room."
"Completely ignoring the fruit�s coloring and texture, local dumbass Luke Jordan reportedly opted for an overripe McIntosh Red when picking apples Friday, even though a Pink Lady was clearly the best variety available given the region�s topography and the lateness of the harvest season. �God, what a complete moron,� said Linda Baxter, a fellow patron at Barton Orchards who cringed as the shit-for-brains bypassed all the perfectly ripened Pink Ladies and Macouns for a McIntosh tree well on its way to dormancy and, given soil acidity levels, incapable of producing apples with the tart-tasting notes or tender white flesh the cultivar is known for. �It�s like, �Look at a calendar, numskull. It�s late October.� That tree bloomed in May and is behind a hill without much access to sunlight, but this dope comes along and mindlessly plucks its fruit without even surveying the hue of its leaves or its trunk health. At the very least, he could have gone for a Golden Delicious or Jonagold. You can tell he doesn�t have an inkling of the effect all our excess rainfall has had on that plant�s wilting pattern. What a loser.� At press time, sources confirmed Baxter�s jaw had dropped after she overheard the fuckwit say he was going to make a pie with his McIntoshes when a blend of Fujis and Cameos would be a far superior option given their flavor profiles this time of year."
"Working feverishly to cover up all evidence of their unsupervised week, a group of hapless teens raced against the clock Friday to clean up the mess from their homicide before their vacationing parents returned. �Shit, shit, shit, if my parents get back and see all the blood and bone flecks all over their living room, we�re definitely gonna be grounded. Like, for the entire year,� said 17-year-old Bobby Klein, claiming his mother would �totally flip� if she noticed how he and his friends had ruined her Persian rug by letting a homeless drifter bleed out on it. �Oh God, they just texted me to see if I want anything from the Whataburger! That�s, like, 20 minutes away! Just stuff those corpses behind the couch where they won�t be able to see them. Jesus, it still smells like death in here. Get the Febeze!� The cleaning frenzy was ultimately a wasted effort, however, as a cheerleader�s severed head fell out of the refrigerator just as Klein�s parents were thanking him for taking such good care of everything while they were away."
"Disrupting the educational process with successive outbursts unburdened by either decorum or civility, badass adult-education student Colin Halverson spent the entirety of Tuesday evening�s Raleigh Extension Center vegetarian cooking class mouthing off. �That guy clearly didn�t give a shit about the $200 he spent to take this, let alone our time and effort,� said a vegetarian cooking classmate of the bad boy, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid verbal retribution, and who noted Halverson�s relentless mocking of the instructor�s clothes and pronunciation of �lasagna.� �I think, at one point, he actually threw Brussels sprouts at the teacher�s head. At first I was, like, what? Get him out of here. But really, it was pretty funny when he pretended that a zucchini was his dick. I hope he�s still in class next week so we can hang and drink more from that flask he snuck in here and make fun of the crocheting class across the hall.� Halverson is currently facing expulsion from the class for blasting Metallica�s �Master of Puppets� from his phone and lighting a cigarette while caramelizing onions."
"Explaining how she was �barely showing,� local man Kevin Martin told reporters Tuesday that the woman who just got on his subway car will have to be way more fucking pregnant than that if she wants to be offered his seat. �There�s no way I�m standing up and moving for someone who looks like they just got knocked up yesterday,� said Martin of the woman who was eight months pregnant, adding that if she was expecting someone to surrender the comfort of their chair just because she was having a contraction here and there, she was out of her goddamn mind. �What is that thing? Seven or eight pounds? Yeah, sorry lady, but you�d better be ready to pop if you want me to give up this spot that I pushed my way into the train to get. Unless you�re on your way to the hospital, you gotta stand just like everyone else.� At press time, Martin commented that there was �no way in hell� that he was giving up a seat for a blind man who clearly had two eyes."
"Refusing to play along with what he immediately knew to be blatant hyperbole, restaurant patron David Ream, 46, publicly declared Monday evening that his �drama queen� waiter was �completely full of shit� about his dinner plate being too hot to touch. �What a fucking liar,� said Ream, who immediately took issue with the waiter�s explicit warning not to handle the plate with an audibly sizzling sirloin steak as it was set down in front of him. �That plate�s maybe a little hotter than plates usually are, but that�s hardly a reason to deliver a little warning speech. Don�t even get me started on the stupid little hot pads that guy pulled out like he was working at freaking Chernobyl.� At press time, Ream was in intensive care at Kalamazoo�s Bronson Memorial Hospital undergoing emergency treatment for third-degree burns on both of his hands, forearms, thighs, and the inside of his mouth."
"Commemorating a life which came to a sudden tragic end before reaching its true counteroffensive potential, mourners from across the community gathered for a vigil outside a Waterloo-area Walmart Sunday evening to honor the memory of 8-year-old Liam Pike, who was killed in a mass shooting at the store last week before getting a chance to return fire. �Today, we join together to celebrate young Liam, a future straight-shooting hero who was taken from us far too soon,� said Reverend Derek Mullhern of Waterloo Baptist, who consoled Melody Pike, Liam�s mother, in her grief at never getting to see her son grow into a big, strong, good guy with a gun who would surely have fired off several careful shots at the gunman. �Because of the selfish, misguided actions of one undoubtedly disturbed and anomalous individual, Liam will never exercise the God-given right to load a handgun, jump over a table while laying down suppressive fire, grit his teeth, and carefully squeeze the trigger while growling �not today.� It is a tragic day for our community.� The vigil was immediately followed by a second vigil in the northern section of the parking lot to memorialize 32-year-old Robert Wilson, a local history teacher and a good guy with a gun who actually managed to take down the shooter before immediately being shot and killed by police.�"
"Decrying the omission as a blatant attempt to stir up controversy, music buff Miles Sherman told reporters Friday that he was pissed to see Blanche Ring�s �Come Josephine In My Flying Machine� left off Pitchfork�s �Best of the 1910s� decade-ending list. �This is such typical Pitchfork horseshit�you�re seriously telling me the greatest song by Blanche Ring doesn�t even land a mention on their rankings?� said Sherman, shaking his head in disbelief as he noted that you couldn�t take a step in the early 20th century without hearing Victrolas playing Ring�s distinctive soprano as she sang about an aviator taking his dearest gal to the moon in a flying contraption. �Oh, I�m sorry that Blanche goddamn Ring, the queen of the vaudeville circuit, doesn�t meet your oh-so-precious standards for great music. Meanwhile, they�re putting crowd-pleasing crap like �Play That Barber-Shop Chord� and �Turn Your Light Off Mister Moon Man� in the top 10. It�s like, are you fucking kidding me? Jack Norworth? Christ, I had to double-check the page just to make sure I wasn�t losing my mind.� At press time, a visibly exasperated Sherman was questioning whether any of the writers who compiled the list were even alive in 1913 to see the true impact of Ring�s �Yip-I-Addy-I-Ay�."
"Saying it would be almost impossible to whittle down all the options, sources confirmed Friday that Halloween pop-up store Spooky City could take its pick of just about any storefront in the rust belt town where it intended to operate until October 31. �Well, I�m seeing a lot of empty windows, so at least we�ll have plenty of room to display our costumes and hopefully lure some folks in,� said Spooky City proprietor Curtis Hawkins, noting that except for the Exxon station, the Goodwill store, and a vape shop, every single retail space he looked at on Main Street was vacant. �I could set up shop in the shuttered Kmart. Looks like I could take just about any place in that strip mall off the interstate, too. I�d use one of these old grocery stores, but they�re all clearly falling down.� At press time, reports confirmed the pop-up store had gone out of business two weeks before Halloween."
"Succumbing to its inherent lash-based nature by releasing its hostility on innocent microorganisms, an aggressive flagellate was observed just going around its shared petri dish Thursday whipping other single-celled organisms. �I was just suspended in solution here�just like any other day�minding my own business and trying to undergo binary fission and reproduce, when this fucking asshole drifts up and starts smacking everyone with its flagellum,� a unicellular Closterium told authorities, claiming that even larger tardigrades were becoming agitated beyond the point of mere Brownian motion by the rude flagellate�s habit of striking out wildly and attacking others for no apparent reason. �And I have to say, it really stings when the flagellum hits you, especially when you�ve got just the one cell to protect yourself. Thank God I�ll only be alive for a few more hours of this.� At press time, all unicellular organisms in the area have resumed their peaceful routines upon learning that an amoeboid protozoan has �taught the flagellate a lesson� by engulfing and digesting it."
"As a divine chorus pealed forth in joy and triumph from the sky above the lake, contractor Charles Taylor admitted that he could never behold the sight of an angel flying down from Heaven to save a drowning little boy without experiencing the almost overwhelming feeling that there must be some sort of higher power at work in the universe. �I�m normally what you might call a skeptical man, but when I witness the sky open in a burst of healing white radiance in which I behold the countenance of an undeniably divine celestial being, I can�t help but wonder if there may be something bigger than all of us,� said Taylor, evidently lost in thought at the possibility of a great design at work in the universe as an unutterably beautiful angel descended upon wings of the purest light to lift a flailing, half-conscious child into its luminous embrace. �I don�t know�maybe I�m just seeing what I want to see in this ethereal winged creature. But there are moments in life; small, still moments of reflection, like a baby laughing, or a smile from a stranger, or maybe that angel clad in numinous glory over there, the one who just restored a child to life and delivered it from watery oblivion to solid ground. It�s enough to make me think that just maybe there�s something more than just this little life of ours.� Taylor reportedly left the scene before he could comment on the angel�s decision to smite over three dozen souls from the lake with a flaming sword for the sins of sodomy, usury, and failing to observe the Sabbath."
"Questioning exactly how the marsupial even made its way to such a small roadside attraction, local father Kyle Conrad, 43, confirmed Tuesday that a kangaroo at the Sherman Farm�s Petting Zoo could not possibly be a good thing. �Man, there�s no way that a kangaroo should just be sitting in a dirty pen at some guy�s farm, right?� said Conrad, stressing that there was no reason to believe the zoo�s sole handler had any idea how to care for an Australian mammal like this one, which was crouched next to a bale of hay alongside enclosures containing a pig, several goats, and a Shetland pony. �I�m assuming that a kangaroo should be jumping around all over the place if he�s healthy. This one hasn�t really moved since we got here. You�re definitely not supposed to just let kids feed pellets to it, either. Jeez, this seems pretty bad.� At press time, Conrad�s concern had dramatically escalated after overhearing the petting zoo�s owner repeatedly refer to the kangaroo as a dingo."
"Reassuring the man that he would receive an immediate response to his emergency, a 911 operator reportedly informed local black caller Jerry Wardell Tuesday that death was on the way. �Thank you for calling 911, please sit tight and don�t worry, first responders will be there to end your life shortly,� said the 911 operator after confirming what Wardell looked like, as well as the identities of others present at the emergency situation, in order to arrange for sufficient agents of death to ensure the expiration of every black life present. �We�ve already dispatched several liquidators into the field, so just remain calm and you should be dead within 10 minutes. If you stay on the line, I�ll be able to talk you through your last breaths and make sure that we�re able to bring you and your loved ones a swift termination.� At press time, the 911 operator was advising the frantic black caller to move to a location where the responding officers would be able to clearly shoot him.�"
"Questioning the motivation and financial wisdom of the recent investment on the part of Blessed Hope Lutheran, parishioners and concerned locals alike confirmed Tuesday that a new, state-of-the-art PA system was �completely squandered� on the church. �Everyone knows that the singing here is nothing to write home about and certainly doesn�t deserve this crystal-clear sound,� said usher David Humphries, 46, gesturing to an array of multiple speakers, high-end microphones, and subwoofers of a quality more commonly found in a dance club than a house of worship. �The new setup allows you to catch every word of the sermon, which, okay, good, sure, but you have to wonder if having a fully functioning lighting system is completely necessary. Also, I don�t want to covet my neighbor�s equipment, but...holy shit, this is a brand new Nord Electro 6. Those babies cost a nice chunk of change!� Disappointed congregants added that Blessed Hope hasn�t even attempted to add a nice flair to their otherwise dreary bake sale announcements by taking advantage of air horn effects built into the cutting-edge soundboard."
"In a new report that reveals she has really enjoyed seeing pictures of you growing up over the years, sources indicated Monday that while you may not remember your mother�s friend, your mother�s friend sure does remember you. �I held you in my arms when you were just a tiny newborn baby, but it�s been so long since I�ve visited, you might not remember my name,� your mom�s friend is quoted as saying in the report, which also indicates that you were only yea high the last time she saw you and have really shot up these past few years. �I�m Jane. Gosh, it seems like it was just yesterday we were playing with Legos and you were calling me Auntie Jane. How are you these days? Are you still into computers?� According to the report, your mom�s friend went on to remark upon how nice your beard looks and ask how long you�ve been wearing it that way."
"Marveling at the glorious majesty of what he had created, social media manager Ryan McCann reportedly whispered �I built this� Monday while beholding his vast empire of successful Fuddruckers tweets. �All should gaze in awe and wonder at the brand-affirming Twitter content I hath wrought,� said McCann, scrolling through the fast-casual hamburger chain�s Twitter feed with quiet certitude that historians will one day study the abundant genius on display in the meme he crafted of American Gothic but with a burger sitting atop the pitchfork. �Even after this mortal form I inhabit turns to dust, these tweets will live on, an eternal monument to my legacy and the gourmet yet affordable burgers that Fuddruckers offers. I serve as merely a vessel of divine inspiration, and Twitter be my canvas. All hail Fuddruckers, all hail me!� At press time, McCann�s boss asked him to delete several tweets that failed to accurately convey the �Fuddruckers ethos.�"
"Suggesting the breakup really left its mark on them, a new report published Monday has concluded that it sure looks like your ex gained some weight once they started dating someone much better than you. �Our findings indicate that as soon as your ex found someone who actually makes them happy, they must have put on four, maybe even five pounds,� the report read in part, citing as evidence your ex�s slightly fuller cheeks, which can be seen on social media in dozens of photos in which they appear smiling alongside a new significant other who truly values and supports them. �In fact, it seems they are no longer underweight at all, their once-hollow, sunken eyes having attained a vigorous new glow in the months since they became involved with a more mature and emotionally secure person. This weight gain certainly won�t be an asset if your ex ever wishes to date someone besides this one person who loves them and has taken them on lots of fun dates and even a trip to Bali, which couldn�t have been cheap.� The report went on to state that you must feel like you really dodged a bullet with that one."
"Encouraged by what he interpreted as �pretty strong signals,� 12-year-old middle school student Brian Foster assumed Friday that Rebecca Saunders, his longtime crush who had spent his middle school�s homecoming dance staring into his eyes, must obviously be waiting for him to make a series of fart noises with his hands. �Having practiced so many times at home, I felt fairly confident going in, but honestly, I was still a little nervous,� said Foster, who carefully wiped just enough sweat from his palms to ensure an entertainingly accurate recreation of human flatulence. �When I saw Rebecca start to smile and lean in close, I thought, all right, this is the moment, this is what she wants right now. I considered slipping my hand into my armpit, but then that slow song started to play and I somehow sensed that even though it was far more difficult, I had to make those quieter squeaky farts using my hands, just for the two of us.� At press time, Saunders was seen on the other side of the gymnasium making out with someone else."
"Watching a new story about the legal loopholes that allow underage American girls to be married off to much older men who have impregnated them, local mother-in-law Cindy Dearborne was overheard muttering to herself Friday that at least someone out there was having a baby. �She may be young, but it�s nice that she gets to put her most fertile years to good use,� Dearborne said within earshot of her daughter-in-law, referring to a 14-year-old girl on the TV screen whose parents forced her to marry a 29-year-old man after they learned she was pregnant with his child. �By getting an early start, she�ll have plenty of time to raise a big, happy family. Plus, she�s learning at a young age that life isn�t all about what she wants. That�s an important lesson�Oh, and look at the grandma! She seems so happy. Probably because she knows she�ll actually get to be around to watch her grandkids grow up.� At press time, sources confirmed Dearborne�s daughter-in-law had left the room immediately upon learning the news show would return after the break with a report on the societal effects of women in the workplace."
"Protesting what they view as glaring hypocrisy, employees at Liberty Point Insurance said they were disheartened Thursday to learn that despite its repeated claims that they were one big family, the company they work for nonetheless objected to them bathing together. �Well, I suppose all that talk about how we�re this tight-knit unit was just so much corporate lip service�otherwise, why would they tell us we can�t lather up and scrub off the dirt with our coworkers?� said adjuster Derek Hanson, who confirmed he felt betrayed by the new position on bathing and, along with other employees, asked how else the company�s phrase �We�re all one family� was supposed to be interpreted. �We were just splish-splashing around a little, and then out of nowhere HR steps in and says we can�t do that anymore. Seriously, how am I supposed to get all the soap off my back without Jim or Kendra or one of my other officemates there to help me with the loofah? This is worse than the time we were all reprimanded for wearing matching overalls to work. No more rub-a-dub-dub? You�ve got to be kidding me.� Hanson went on to speculate that next, he and his coworkers would be prohibited from crawling into their boss�s arms to calm down after a scary nightmare."
"Compelled by a power greater than himself to leave his beloved home and tread the path of all-surpassing glory, Sawyer, a 4-year-old Jack Russell Terrier, set off Wednesday on a pilgrimage to that selfsame consecrated site where he once found a whole rotisserie chicken resting by the side of the road. Upon his 45-minute journey, Sawyer faced and overcame great adversity, including a barrage of insistent tugging on the leash held by his faithless owner; various unspeakable yet seductive odors; and the many temptations offered by other neighborhood dogs, yet he remained steadfast in the pursuit of meaty possibilities. Fueled by his simple yet powerful faith and drawn ever onward by visions of the glorious bounty that might very well await him, from humble parcels of abandoned bacon to split-open canned hams to the dream of an entire 3-foot length of abandoned Genoa salami, Sawyer marched on, the light of his faith undimmed. Upon his arrival at the divine location, in line with canine eschatology, Sawyer bowed his head, bent his keen nose to his task, and began to circle and criss-cross the area in hopes of a sign. At press time, it was confirmed that Sawyer�s owners had unsuccessfully attempted to prevent him from consuming the remains of a week-old roast beef sandwich and have rushed him to an emergency animal clinic."
"Vowing to never give up hope, local man Mark Prasad admitted Tuesday that he�s starting to think he didn�t win the Kellogg�s Frosted Flakes 1995 sweepstakes for a free trip to the Australian Outback. �Every day, I check the mail in hopes of finding a flashy envelope from Kellogg�s telling me to pack my bags because I�ve been randomly selected to spend four days and five nights camping in the Outback, and every day I�m bitterly disappointed,� said Prasad, 42, who began to suspect something was wrong back in 2004 when he emailed the Kellogg�s public feedback account to enquire whether they had announced a winner and failed to receive a response. �The 24 years between when I mailed in the raffle entry card from the back of the Frosted Flakes box and now has tested my resolve, but I�m trying to stay positive. I�ve done a ton of research on Australia, and I know exactly what I need to pack to make sure I have a memorable vacation. The fine print says the winner gets to take a guest. I used to think I�d bring my best friend Lucas, but now I guess I�ll have to invite my wife.� When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Kellogg�s confirmed that a winner for the 1995 sweepstakes would be announced later this month."
"In a report suggesting that the boss had come in this morning with an even sharper-than-usual appearance, sources confirmed Monday that must be a new suit, sir, and it sure looks great. �Not everyone could pull off an outfit like that, but the boss does it with ease,� said eagerly grinning sources, noting that the head honcho had completed his impressive look with a stylish new haircut and that it appears he�s lost weight, though sources added they didn�t know how he found the time due to always burning the midnight oil at the office. �It�s safe to say that the missus bought that gorgeous silk tie that goes so perfectly with the jacket, which serves as another indicator that the boss sure knows how to pick �em.� The report concluded by acknowledging that it was the honor of a lifetime to get to work for such a finely tailored man."
"Noting that a huge weight had been taken off his shoulders, newly enlightened man Ken Eaton announced Monday that learning to love himself has freed him from the burden of extensive and painful self-reflection. �It�s nice to finally have accepted my flaws, because doing so allows me to stop the tiresome practice of unpacking my issues, admitting to myself that I�ve been a corrosive force in the lives of those close to me, and working constantly to change my often overwhelming flaws as a human being,� said Eaton, who repeatedly remarked on how grateful he was to be done with introspection after realizing that his defects are the very things that make him special. �It really hurt when I had to confess my shortcomings to myself and make an effort to improve as a human being instead of just embracing the fact that, hey, I�m only a human being. But it�s smooth sailing for me now that I can view my serious faults through a love strong enough to make me see them as my greatest strengths.� Going forward, Eaton plans to work hard with other people to make them accept the worst facets of his character instead of changing his behaviour to meet basic human standards"
"According to sources in attendance at the ceremony, area man Daniel Walter was wed Saturday to Kelly Kaminski, a woman he hardly even knows after five years of dating. �Kelly, you are my rock, my everything, and you never cease to amaze me,� said Walter, 37, who is reportedly deluding himself if he thinks he�s ready to marry Kaminski, considering he doesn�t know what, if anything, he truly has in common with the 34-year-old executive assistant he started dating in 2010. �I love you, and I can�t wait for us to begin this adventure together.� Sources also stated that the bride must be pretty na�ve if she thinks she knows what she�s getting into with a man who is always forgetting the names of all her closest friends he�s fucked."
"Briefly interrupting her weekend cleaning to pop her head into the living room, local mom Shandi Ames arrived from the other room Sunday for her semi-hourly report on the Pittsburgh Steelers football game. �How is everything going? Are they winning?� asked Ames, collecting dirty plates and empty cups from the coffee table while giving intermittent glances at the television screen. �Everything still going okay in here? I hope the game is going well. And how�s that player I like doing?� At press time, Ames was shouting �What�s wrong? What happened?� from the kitchen after hearing audible groans and shouting from the living room."
"Removing the item from her Amazon shopping cart, local server Melanie Avila confirmed Thursday that she was holding off on buying herself new headphones so her boyfriend can surprise her with a shittier pair for her birthday. �I have my eye on these really nice Bose noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones, but I figure I can hold out a few more weeks and let James gift me some cheapo imitation bullshit instead,� said Avila, 34, noting her plan is to immediately return the knockoffs and use the credit to buy what she really wants or simply wait for the cut-rate electronics to break so she can replace them. �I�ve been dropping hints like, �I really want these specific headphones,� and, �Here�s a link to the headphones I like,� but I know he�ll manage to find some off-brand wired earbuds with zero features at a mall kiosk. When I tear open the wrapping paper and discover he got me some junky JVC or Skullcandy garbage, I�ll tell him how much I love them and that they�re exactly what I wanted. Honestly, the best present of all would be if he remembers to get a gift receipt.� At press time, Avila was secretly delighted to inform her boyfriend that the fake AirPods came out of the box already busted."
"After observing one cop barking orders, a second marking off the area with police tape, and a third drawing a chalk outline around a body, sources confirmed Wednesday that a crime scene in a downtown neighborhood appeared to have all the different types of cops. �There�s the ones with ties, the ones in uniform, the ones with plastic gloves who collect evidence�man, they�ve got at least one of every kind of cop you can think of,� said onlooker Ben Roberts, who noted that the precinct appeared to have pulled out all the stops, sending over cops in trench coats, traffic cops to keep things moving, rookie cops who weren�t used to all this violence, grizzled alcoholic cops who had seen too much, and even some casually dressed plainclothes cops who looked like regular people but were really cops. �Detectives, forensics, a transit cop who just poked his head up out of the subway�I think I even saw a cop on a horse. Oh, look! That one cop just flashed his badge, told all the other cops this was his crime scene now, and brought in a whole new set of cops! He must be a big, big cop!� At press time, witnesses confirmed the big cop had instructed riot cops to disperse the angry crowd that had gathered so the cops who plant drugs on the bodies of cop-shooting victims could get to work."
"After spending decades focused solely on his career and then retirement, local 70-year-old man Dennis Lambert was reportedly worried Tuesday that he was running out of time to have kids. �My biological clock is ticking, and I�m concerned there won�t be many more opportunities to start a family,� said Lambert, explaining that when you�re �getting up there� in age, there are certain realities you have to start thinking about, namely that you may only have 10 or 20 viable years left to father a child, unless you want to be that 95-year-old dad playing with his kid at the park, being watched in silent judgment by onlookers. �I�m worried that I�m going to wake up one day and realize the chance to have children has passed me by because I�m dead. It just sucks that as a man, you only have this small, 80-year window in which you are able to procreate and that you are forced to choose between enjoying your retirement or having children.� At press time, Lambert was considering freezing his sperm."
"Saying he can tell from the way she�s been looking at him that she clearly expects him to pop the question, local man Dwayne Moyer told reporters Friday he feels pressure to propose to his girlfriend, Samantha Firks, after dating her for three years, buying her a ring, and getting down on one knee. �Man, just because we�ve been together for a while, and because I knelt before her and opened a velvet box containing a $10,000 diamond ring, she�s suddenly acting like it�s time we got engaged,� said Moyer, explaining how he flew his significant other to Italy for their anniversary, hired a string quartet to serenade Firks, and was now being made to feel as if he had no choice but to ask her to be his wife. �It really isn�t fair of her to do this. I hinted that today was going to be a �special,� paid a professional photographer to capture the moment, and this is what I get in return? A guilt trip about getting married? To make matters worse, ever since I asked her father�s permission for her hand in marriage, her whole family has been bugging me about when I�m going to do it, which is making me super uncomfortable.� Moyer added that he was also feeling pressure to have kids with Firks now that the couple had finally succeeded after months of trying to conceive a child together."
"As he peered out the window of his family�s Dodge Caravan and spotted the animal right in the middle of a pasture where nobody could miss it, 2-year-old Owen Kincaid reportedly pointed out a cow to his parents Monday, acting as if they don�t have eyes in their fucking heads. �Cow!� said Kincaid, who, though sources confirmed his mother and father have made eye contact with him since the day he was born, is apparently enough of an idiot to think they can�t see the goddamn 1,500-pound bovine directly in their field of vision�or else enough of an asshole to think he needs to remind his college-educated parents what a goddamn cow is. �Look, look! Cow.� At press time, sources confirmed the piece-of-shit toddler, who appears to consider himself a fucking expert on such matters, informed everyone in the car that cows go moo."
"Feeling comforted by the news that the scandalous and illicit affair eventually amounted to something, school district sources noted Monday that, well, at least high school teacher Lisa Calloway, 52, and her former student Dennis Wilkes, 32, had married. �It was definitely fucked up that Ms. Calloway started sleeping with Dennis when he was in her junior year AP English class, but I guess it makes it somewhat better that they wound up tying the knot,� said the newlywed couple�s former classmate and student Jeffrey Stefanoff, acknowledging that it was �a bit of a silver lining� to find the two had remained together during the years Calloway spent serving her prison sentence. �I suppose it�s good that, although their relationship is absolutely founded on a grossly unequal power dynamic, that it eventually settled into a socially acceptable structure. And we know for certain that in the case of the marriage, he was both consenting and capable of doing so. That�s kind of a win?� At press time, the couple has announced their separation due to Calloway becoming romantically involved with a much, much younger man."
"Despite expressing to her on numerous past occasions the gravity of making this sort of mistake, sources confirmed Tueasday that, God fucking damnit, the live-in maid had sorted the satins and cottons together again. �Oh, for Christ�s sake, how many times have we told Maria not to put the baronet weave and pima cotton into the same drawer,� sources noted, stressing that despite living just down the hall in the spare guest room, she somehow could not seem to do a single goddamn thing right around this house. �First, she puts the whiskey tumblers and the champagne flutes next to each other on the credenza, and now this? Honestly, I feel like I�m losing my mind. Just look at them�the acala is folded right in with the charmeuse, and the Monroe is paired with the spare Egyptian. This is a complete fucking disaster.� At press time, reports had confirmed that if something like this ever happened again, they would simply call immigration."
"Preparing to humiliate both his mother and the employee in one fell swoop, local 3-year-old Alex Delaney confirmed Tuesday that he was going to hold in the fact that the grocery store cashier is fat until he reaches the checkout. �Right now, I�m just thinking about the fact that the man is overweight, but once our cart reaches the register, I�m going to blurt out to everyone within earshot that he�s fat,� said the toddler, adding that he�s still deciding between emphatically stating �You�re fat� or quizzically asking �Mommy, why is that man fat?� �First, I�m going to lull him into a false sense of security by smiling at him and then giggling when he smiles back. Then when he trusts me�bam�I�m gonna let loose my discovery that he�s the fattest man I�ve ever seen. It�s pretty ingenious, really. This is just like the time I told grandma she�s gonna die soon because she�s so old.� At press time, Delaney outlined plans to squeeze his penis for the entirety of his preschool�s concert program."
"Expressing his disbelief and disappointment over purchasing the Sinaloa drug cartel�s products for decades while remaining ignorant of their less-than-ethical attitude toward competing business, regular cocaine customer Richard Barnes confirmed this week that he was shocked to learn the powerful international drug-trafficking organization had helped fund death squads. �I have to say, it�s really disturbing to learn that such a popular and respected institution could do something like this,� said Barnes, who admitted he personally enjoyed the syndicate�s high-quality cocaine, but was disappointed to learn how they had financially supported paramilitary groups that carried out repeated extrajudicial killings of cartel opponents. �Consumers vote with their wallets, and it feels morally wrong to buy their coke, no matter how highly refined, if your money could potentially be paying criminals to repress, torture, and assasinate their rivals. It�s crazy that people don�t know about this�I should alert Sleeping Giants.� Barnes, who has reportedly written the Sinaloa cartel a harshly worded letter denouncing their practices and declaring his intent to take his recreational drug business elsewhere, has not been seen for three days."
"In the six weeks since classes began at Plano Senior High School, quiet, nerdy student Henry Orvis, 16, has been lying in wait and looking for just the right moment to unleash his freestyle rap talents on his fellow sophomores, sources reported Monday. �Soon, very soon, the time will be right, and I daresay they won�t know what hit them when I start spitting mad fire,� said the unpopular Orvis, who reportedly spent much of the summer practicing his MC skills alone in his bedroom so that, upon returning to school last month, he could �catch wreck� with students in his class. �Just wait until these high school fools find out I�ve got flow like Nas. They have no idea what kind of nasty rhymes I have in store for them. They�ll never see it coming.� At press time, sources confirmed Orvis was not yet four bars into his first public freestyle attempt when his classmates beat the shit out of him.�"
"Lowering his expectations in an effort to avoid disappointment, rookie forest ranger TJ Hayward told reporters Friday that he was not getting his hopes up about seeing a tree on his first day of work. �If it happens, that would be great, but I�m not going to hold my breath for a lodgepole pine on day one,� said Hayward, noting that one of his colleagues who has already been there over six months hasn�t seen even a single spruce or fir yet. �Of course I�d love to come across a majestic aspen in the wild, but I know it could be years before that happens, if it happens at all. I�ll just keep an eye out for any tree droppings that I may notice on the trails. I know that if I see a squirrel, there�s probably a tree nearby.� At press time, Hayward was speechless and on the verge of tears after stumbling upon a beautiful, towering wooden utility pole."
"Noting that the 85-year-old�s luggage had not even been carried from the foyer to her new room yet, medical staff told reporters Thursday that area grandmother Mary Rosenstein had contracted herpes within five minutes of checking into Tompkins Manor nursing home. �She got her name tag, she got her welcome packet, then boom�STIs,� said nurse Larry Ashbern, adding that even before Rosenstein�s family had pulled their car out of the parking lot, the widowed grandmother of 12 had already engaged in enough unprotected sex with enough partners to contract several strains of Herpesviridae. �Within seconds of saying goodbye to her loved ones and finding a room with a door she could lock, Mrs. Rosenstein had been exposed to, and no doubt passed along, numerous sexually transmitted infections. By dinner tonight, we�re expecting a full-on, facility-wide outbreak of not only herpes simplex types 1 and 2, but also chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, and who knows what other diseases. Which is really not all that unusual anytime a new patient arrives at our facility.� At press time, medical staff reported that every single resident of Tompkins Manor had developing several open, oozing cold sores."
"Noting that, oh shit, the little guy really went down hard, sources close to the situation confirmed Thursday that a toddler just face-planted right onto the sidewalk. �Oh, Jesus, he was walking fine and then�bam�down he went,� said onlooker Danielle Roper, who watched as local toddler Lucas Novich tripped and just slammed face-first into the concrete, damn. �Oh my god, he didn�t even get his hands up in time. He just crashed into the pavement. Christ.� At press time, fuck, that kid was really screaming."
"Emphasizing that some alone time was a completely healthy way to keep things in perspective, coworkers confirmed Thursday that 31-year-old retail employee Andy Ellison has a little daily ritual of sitting down on a box in a quiet corner of the stock room, drinking most of a can Dr. Pepper, and not killing himself. �Every day, he just slips in there with a drink, takes a breather, and casually but consciously decides not to put a bullet in his brain,� said junior sales associate Suzanne Rehnquist, noting that Ellison occasionally also brought a bag of Fritos, but never a firearm, into the peaceful back room adjacent to the store�s Sports & Outdoors section. �Andy knows what he needs, and if that means having a little daily routine where he takes five minutes, sips a soda, and doesn�t wrap his mouth around the barrel of a handgun and send brain matter and skull fragments fountaining into the office supplies, good for him.� Sources have expressed doubts as to whether Ellison will be able to keep up his little routine for much longer."
"Gifting them another 7-year-old as a token of appreciation for their patience, local adoption agency Kindred Family Focus reportedly gave a couple who waited a long time an extra kid free of charge Wednesday. �We know we kept you waiting for a child for a long time, so in order to show our thanks, we�ve decided to throw in a freebie,� said Eric Steadfast, the agency manager, explaining how they would be waving all the associated fees as a small gesture of goodwill for the couple�s loyalty. �We want to make sure our customers are pleased with their service, so we�ve decided to make this deal a twofer, with the second child being totally complimentary. Hopefully, you�ll enjoy John and Derrick�they should go well together.� At press time, the couple was wondering if they could get a sportier model in a different color.�"
"Praising those who had leapt into action to prevent the incident from escalating, relieved authorities announced Wednesday that they had thankfully stopped a school shooter before he did enough damage to restart the national gun debate. �We�re all certainly glad that the shooter was only able to kill two students and injure a teacher before law enforcement arrived and prevented it from becoming a full-blown national dialogue,� said police chief Walter McMurray, adding that his department�s quick response ensured that tens of millions of Americans could sleep soundly knowing that they�d never have to discuss this particular shooting. �While it�s tragic that the shooter was able to cause two vigils, we�re grateful that it wasn�t quite enough carnage to spark any protests or plunge the nation into another week of discussing what we should about this. Our thoughts and prayers go out to any local residents who may be affected by conversations about gun violence over the next few days.� At press time, authorities responding to an unrelated incident in Georgia expressed how thankful they were that the shooting that killed seven people and wounded nearly a dozen others at least didn�t occur in a school."
"Emphasizing the importance of providing comfort and support, social media manager Gillian Dearborne assured her longtime friend Julie Kaplan Tuesday that she would always be just a phone call, prefaced by 45 minutes of breathless meandering about some guy she�s seeing, away. �If you ever need me for anything�anything at all�you only have to call me up, wait quietly for me to finish an unrelenting torrent of speculation about how my relationship with some dope you�ve never met is going, and I�ll be there for you,� said Dearborne, who prides herself on being a compassionate presence for friends once they sit through exhausting tirades about two mediocre dates she went on with a Tinder guy she�s not sure she even likes. �I�m serious! Anytime, day or night, you give me a ring, and I�ll spend most of the call laying out multiple theories about what a text message I got two weeks ago could possibly mean, and then I�ll suddenly end the conversation because I have to get ready for a date.� At press time, Kaplan�s attempt to interrupt a half-hour soliloquy about someone named Trevor had been promptly steamrolled."
"Saying that the U.S. history teacher had freaked out over basically nothing, classroom sources confirmed Monday that Mr. Bennington completely lost his shit in third period. �We were in the middle of a unit on World War II and Kyle was just sort of talking with some friends, and all of a sudden, Mr. Bennington shouted �For crying out loud, Kyle!� and slammed his fist down really hard on his desk,� said student Meredith Lynn, recalling that the normally affable teacher had been so incensed that he even yelled at Julie and Devon who had only been listening to Kyle and hadn�t even made a peep. �There was a vein popping out of his forehead, and he goes, �Get the Hell out of my class��he actually said �Hell��and makes Kyle pack up and leave. And even after he calmed down, it was still super intense. He just had us all read quietly for the rest of the period until the bell rang.� At press time, sources reported that Mr. Bennington hadn�t yet shown up for his fourth-period class."
"Sighing in resignation at the time he had squandered on such unimportant concerns, dying man Abe Prenderghast, 83, confessed Monday that his greatest regret was wasting so much of life obsessing over people he had systematically abducted and strangled. �Now that I�m at the end of the road, it�s hard for me not to look back and wonder why I ever got so worked up about what a bunch of strangers said to me as I watched the life drain from their eyes,� said the elderly man from his deathbed, lamenting the hours he had thrown away just replaying trivial comments branding him as a monster or tearfully begging him to stop as he tightened his gloved grip around their windpipe. �That�s so much of my life that I�ll never get back, and in the end, I didn�t even know most of these people. So, did the fact that they call me a sociopath affect me? Of course not. If anything, I could have spent all that mental energy suffocating even more people, dressing them in Native American regalia, ejaculating, and then burying their bodies in my orchid garden. Oh, well.� Prenderghast went on to note that he was determined to live his final day well and had already found a lightweight orderly who would help him do so."
"Reflecting wryly on the latest batch of rookies to head its way, a grizzled beer can being used as an ashtray reportedly watched Monday as another cocky 12-pack came and went through the patio. �These new cans breeze in, fresh and clean from the grocery store shelf, thinking they�re hot shit, but I guarantee you by the end of the night, they�ll all be lying facedown in a recycling bin somewhere,� said the dented 12-ounce Pabst Blue Ribbon can, confirming that it had yet to encounter another can with the tenacity to hold the cigarette butts and rainwater that had allowed it to maintain its position for so long. �Witbiers, sours, IPAs�I�ve survived �em all. They think they�re so damn special because they�re a microbrew or they have some extra-high A.B.V., but that�s not how things work in the real world. Most of these new cans will never even make it past the first round of flip cup. I tell you, the things I�ve seen happen to beer cans on this back porch would make you shudder.� At press time, the can had reportedly resigned itself to a long, lonely winter until a new group of beverage vessels arrived next spring."
"Saying he had wholly misread his office mate�s mild, occasional interest in talking to him, sources confirmed Monday that local software engineer Michael Donner had mistakenly concluded that sitting in close proximity to a coworker for eight hours each day constituted friendship. �Yeah, I guess you could say Dave [Reynolds] and I are pretty tight,� said the clearly confused Donner, appearing to believe that simply because they share an office and thus engage in brief and perfunctory exchanges from time to time, Reynolds must consider him some sort of deeply cherished companion with whom he has forged an intimate bond. �We�ll get to talking and have a lot of really great [banal discussions about the weather or lunch]. Dave and I even have our own little [two-word pleasantries voiced to avoid an awkward silence after accidentally making eye contact]. What can I say? He�s the best.� When reached for comment on the relationship, Dave Reynolds required multiple clarifications before figuring out which Michael at the office reporters were referring to."
"Saying it was never too early to begin instilling the values they believe in, liberal parents Christopher and Stacey Castaneda confirmed Friday that they were struggling to find a school district with high-quality drag queens. �We�re committed to finding a school system that has well-paid, skilled drag queens who can provide our son with the kind of education he needs to be successful,� said Christopher, adding that the child�s current school has a ratio of only one drag queen for every 32 students, leaving little time for one-on-one instruction. �We want Caleb to have access to a wide variety of styles�fish drag, camp queens, activessles�not just the same old busted Tina Turner impersonator he has now. Ideally, we�d have him in a drag queen�immersion program, but at the very least, we want a district where its a core part of the curriculum. Stage presence and wow factor are a must, and if the queen is bilingual, that�s even better.� At press time, the parents announced plans to enroll Caleb in private school after witnessing St. Edward�s Academy�s absolutely stunning autumn drag pageant."
"Shaking their heads in dismay at the clueless couple�s child-rearing difficulties, onlookers speculated Thursday that a husband and wife trying to screw their infant son into a light bulb socket must be first-time parents. �Boy, I know there�s a learning curve for raising a kid, but it doesn�t make it any easier to see first-time parents struggling with the basics like this,� said onlooker Jeffrey Garrett, cringing as he watched the wide-eyed, panicking husband strain to push his newborn�s head into the open socket before waving away his wife�s suggestion that they just try plugging the girl into a wall outlet. �I don�t want to be the jerk that goes over there and tells them they�re doing it all wrong, but man, oh man, this is just such a classic mistake. I knew from the second I walked up and saw them swaddling that little guy in an electrical cord that they were way out of their depths.� At press time, onlookers were nodding in approval after the parents had learned from their mistakes and soothed the squirming infant by giving her a spark plug to suckle."
"Urging the feisty senior to pace herself, concerned Jackson family sources confirmed Wednesday that rowdy grandmother Arlene Jackson was seen careening around her son-in-law�s birthday party double-fisting grandchildren. �Nana�s got her arms so full of grandbabies that she�s practically falling over�she needs to slow down,� said Jackson�s daughter Olivia, echoing the sentiments of other adult party guests as they witnessed the manic 77-year-old cover her infant grandson with kisses before moving on to pinch the cheeks of four other grandchildren. �She already had both of my nieces on her lap when she snatched baby Charlie out of my hands. We told her to take it easy, but she stamped over and loud-whispered that she knows her limits. I mean, other people want to see the kids, too, but Arlene is just not handing them over.� Jackson was later seen slumped over in a recliner with several toddlers strewn about her feet, evidently passed out after several hours of binge-kissing."
"Visibly annoyed after his auction closed with a winning bid far below his expectations, actor Matt Damon begrudgingly accepted $50 Monday from the eBay auction of his cast and crew jacket from the sci-fi thriller The Martian. �I sort of don�t want to part with my only memento from my time on that set, but I really need the cash,� said Damon, noting that other than a grape fruit juice stain on its left sleeve, the jacket was in near-mint condition and should sell for �way more� given its connection to a real Hollywood movie. �I had assumed there would be a bidding war or something, but almost no one bit. And I was banking on using the cash from this to cover my acting classes. As it is, I�m actually losing a little money on the whole thing. I should have never agreed to pay shipping on this.� Damon�s mood reportedly changed to anger after learning the person who bought the jacket resold the item in two days later for $475."
"Wincing at the smell of formaldehyde as she entered the beauty school morgue, cosmetology student Linda Emerson admitted Wednesday that she was nervous for the part of her studies where she�d have to cut hair on cadavers. �I know it�s important to practice before you give a haircut to a living, breathing person, but doing a bob-chop on an 80-year-old dead lady just really freaks me out,� said Emerson, who, after shampooing her cadaver�s hair in the sink with the help of other students, was chastised by an instructor for ripping off a part of the scalp during what should have been a routine blow-drying exercise. �I really want to be respectful of the dead because they donated their bodies so I could learn to cut pixies, bouffants, and buzz cuts. I can�t even tell you how scared I am to start practicing the waxing unit, though�cadaver Brazilians are going to kill me.� At press time, sources said that Emerson was frantically trying to piece her mangled cadaver back together after accidentally chopping the entire head off while attempting to clean up the neckline."
"Admitting that she may have a dependency issue with the soothing Celestial Seasonings herbal infusion, longtime Sleepytime Tea addict Katie Ball divulged Tuesday that she must consume six bags of the sedative brew in order to merely feel drowsy. �I started using Sleepytime to treat insomnia, which worked great for a while, but before I realized what was happening, I needed more and more of that chamomile-and-valerian-root magic to get me to the level of relaxation I craved,� said Ball, whose hands shook while placing half-dozen bags of the caffeine-free herbal sleep aid into her preferred mug and paced the room while waiting for the kettle to boil. �I can barely even close my eyes if I�m not riding a hit of spearmint and lemongrass. I�m spending hundreds of bucks a month. If I don�t get my Sleepytime, I become agitated and hyper-alert. I�ve even snorted raw chamomile leaves a couple times even though I know what that could do to me.� Ball, who has often told those close to her that she intended to stop her Sleepytime use cold turkey, was discovered unconscious by her husband late Tuesday night, her hand still clutching a 120-tablet bottle of melatonin pills."

"Observing that the choicest bits were long gone, a local fly confirmed Friday that by the time it discovered the piece of dog shit near a tree in Ridgefield Park, the defecation had been pretty well picked over. �Dang, you can tell this was some real primo shit, probably from a pit bull or something,� said the fly, lamenting that there wasn�t much to choose from beyond a few dry, undigested crumbs and some hair. �It�s been sitting in the sun for a while, which is great, but someone already got to all the good chunks. I wish I�d gotten here five or 10 minutes ago, because I�m not even sure I can piece together a full meal from what�s left.� At press time, onlookers reported that the fly�s day appeared to have improved dramatically after it discovered a fresh pile of human shit the next alley over."
"Moments after pushing his chair out from the table in resignation, local restaurant patron Joe Wright, who had previously thrown a wadded-up napkin into the center of his plate, announced Tuesday that he would come out of retirement for one last stab at his burger. �Although I signaled my retirement just moments ago with a contented sigh and a wipe at the aioli on the corner of my mouth, I just hated the idea that I was the kind of person who would leave some burger out on that plate,� said Wright, stressing that he would be haunted for the rest of his life if he walked away without doing his best to finish the cheeseburger, questioning what kind of example such a defeatist attitude might present to his children. �After all, I�m only 42. In many ways, I�m still at the top of my game. So today, I�m here to say that it was too early for me to count myself out. In fact, who knows? I might even dabble in some of those hand-cut fries.� At press time, Wright�s family had convened a press conference to announce that he had died while choking on a large mouthful of burger."
"Clumsily slobbering over each other like ham-fisted amateurs, a pair of teenagers sighted making out in the park Monday had absolutely no idea what the hell they were doing, dismayed onlookers confirmed. �From what I can see, they�re just shoving fingers into each other�s half-open mouth while he laboriously tries to work his hand up her shirt, which apparently he doesn�t realize is tucked into her jeans,� said one of the many eyewitnesses, going on to elaborate on how the two 15-year-olds needed to adjust their configuration and methodology in order to facilitate better breathing and, overall, simply take things slower and more gently. �These morons are never going to turn each other on if they can�t figure out how to deal with the elbow situation. Oh, Jesus, did she just lick his cheek? What the fuck?� Public safety officers were eventually dispatched to the scene to show the young couple how it should be done. "
"Noting that the little fucker must be in some seriously deep shit to be booking it like that, local man Albert Chu told reporters Friday that the centipede tearing ass across his floor must be really late for something. �I dunno if he slept through a meeting or if he forgot to pick up his centipede kids or whatever, but those hundred legs of his were straight-up motoring,� said Chu, adding that just a few minutes earlier, he had watched the Scutigera coleoptrata burst out of a crack in the shower grout and immediately start sprinting towards a gap below the bathroom door. �While I�m not totally sure where that little guy was going, at one point he was hauling ass so hard that he straight up ate it and fell three feet off the side of the raised bathroom tub. Oh, God. I hope he didn�t get fired.� At press time, Chu said he hoped whoever the centipede was meeting wouldn�t be too mad that he had crushed the insect beneath his foot and flushed it down the toilet."
"Noting that the industry probably �chewed him up and spit him out,� classroom sources at Sanford Middle School speculated Wednesday that sexual education teacher Nathan Brown, 33, must not have been able to cut it as a professional sex worker. �It�s kind of depressing to think of Mr. Brown struggling for years to break through as a male escort, leaving him with no choice but to turn his talents to education,� said 8th-grader Sara Bowden, as she watched a droning Brown listlessly point to a diagram of the female reproductive system. �It has to be tough to come back to your hometown with your tail between your legs after failing to become L.A.�s hot new sexual superstar. I just hope he can find a quiet joy in passing down his knowledge of sex to us.� Brown�s students, who overall expressed respect for his work and guidance, were unanimous in vowing to learn from his experience and never end up stuck in some dead-end teaching job."
"Revealing a strategy for protecting himself from criticism, local man Blake Cotton reportedly speculated Wednesday that if anyone ever calls him out on privilege, he�ll just make something up about being molested. �I mean, if someone ever tells me to think about how my position as a white male informs my viewpoint, I�ll probably just say that my dad diddled me,� said Cotton, explaining that pretending he was sexually abused by a camp counselor or touched by a priest was a pretty foolproof plan for getting people off his back for being a cisgendered straight man. �Granted, I�m from a pretty wealthy family, but all I really have to do is cryptically allude to what happens in rich homes behind closed doors. There�s no way they�re asking follow-up questions after that, and if they do, I can claim that I repressed all the memories from the traumatic event and I�m golden.� At press time, the person Cotton was speaking to informed him that they had also been molested."
"Explaining that such suggestive armor was inappropriate for an educational environment, Huntington High School officials reportedly reminded female students Tuesday that their bulletproof vests must cover their midriffs. �We�ve been seeing some students wearing revealing bulletproof vests, so I just wanted to remind all you ladies that your kevlar must cover all your vital organs,� said Vice Principal James Nelson on the morning announcements, forewarning students that if they lift their arms up and any part of their stomach is exposed, then they would be sent to the nurse�s office and forced to borrow one of the school�s own ballistic vests, which are large and unsightly. �This is about respecting your classmates as well as respecting yourself. It�s distracting, not to mention inappropriate, to use your bulletproof vest to present yourself in a sexual manner during the school day. You can wear whatever type of tactical gear you want when you�re at home or at the mall, but when you�re here, it must be a longer, more modest item of personal armor.� At press time, the students were reminded that they could still customize their kevlar vests any way they want."
"Searching her brain for even the slightest upside, local parent Sarah Bolen found herself struggling Monday to find a good reason why Sophia, her 5-year-old daughter, should not be afraid of starting the first grade. �Don�t worry, there�s nothing to be scared of, other than constant judgment from dozens of kids you don�t know,� said Bolen said, stressing that little Sophia was not to let the combined pressures of academic and social achievement get to her despite the fact that how she performs in school and how she is perceived by peers would determine the trajectory and outcome of her entire life. �You�re going to make so many friends, honey! Though there are actually a lot of people who aren�t that good at making friends, and you could very likely be one of them. Oh, and now that I think of it, it�s true that school shootings happen sort of all the time now.� Bolen also assured her daughter that even in the event that she had a bad first day, things would get better eventually, provided she was not kidnapped on her walk home."
"Exhausting his reserves of confidence well before first-period roll call, student Logan Mahaffey found the self-esteem he painstakingly acquired during summer theater camp could only get him through his first six minutes of the school year, the 7th-grader admitted Monday. �If I can play the lead in Jesus Christ Superstar, there�s nothing I can�t do,� said Mahaffey, mere moments before a classmate threw a water bottle at his head after noticing him whistling the tune to �I Got Rhythm.� �Up on that stage, I felt like I was truly myself for the first time, and now I know I can conquer anything. I can�t wait to tell everyone about [the things they will mercilessly torment me about for the rest of the school year, using my enthusiasm for theater as a rationale to exclude me from all social functions].� At press time, Mahaffey was unaware that tomorrow�s pummeling from classmates for wearing an Anything Goes cast T-shirt would have a much greater impact on his self-esteem."
"Observing that she seems to �go a bit overboard� with her enthusiasm for the season, sources confirmed Friday that local woman Linda Gillespie is so obsessed with Christmas that she worships Jesus Christ throughout the entire year. �Even in summer, Linda will be brimming with the holiday spirit and praising the Lord Jesus as her savior,� said neighbor Daniel Bonn, explaining that Gillespie goes so far as to attend a Christ-themed service every Sunday of the year as if it were Christmas morning. �I like Christmas as much as the next guy, but considering it�s not even Thanksgiving yet, don�t you think it�s a little odd that the inside of her home is decorated with a bunch of depictions of Christ? She�s also apparently joined some kind of weird choir that sing songs about Jesus year-round.� At press time, sources confirmed Gillespie had finally let go of the Christmas spirit after a severe crisis of faith caused her to stop believing in God altogether."
"Rending his garments and dashing towards the door as his face began to twist in anguish, distraught man Andrew Wan, brought to the verge of tears by personal news of a deeply distressing nature, reportedly burst out of a crowded room Friday like he was transforming into a werewolf. �Oh, God, no! It�s happening again,� said Wan, groaning through moistening eyes and hiding his face in his white-knuckled hands as if to hide the bristling fur bursting forth from his skin and his skull elongating into a terrifying lupine form. �Get back! For the love of God, I beseech you, avert your eyes from my hideous aspect and leave me be!� A howling Wan was later sighted running into the woods, presumably in a desperate attempt to keep his dark secret hidden.�"
"Expressing regret that she just didn�t have the time to properly look after the locks, local woman Nicole Parker reportedly tearfully parted with her long hairstyle Thursday after realizing she couldn�t provide it with the kind of care it deserves. �I�m sorry, but I just can�t give you what you need anymore,� said Parker, explaining how she didn�t have it in her to complete the hair masks and conditioning required to maintain and nurture the haircut. �Maybe this could have been possible at another time in another place, but right now, I can�t be brushing you as much as you want. I�m sorry, I wish I was better.� At press time, Parker assured herself that the long hair would be better off with the guy who bought it online.�"
"Pointing with great emphasis and loudly declaring her impressions of her surroundings, local toddler Sophia Krauss, 3, was reportedly standing up in a shopping cart and surveying the grocery store in the manner of a grizzled, windburnt sea captain on a long and perilous whaling expedition. Witnesses confirmed that the preschooler belabored her crew with the energy of a fate-possessed Bligh or Ahab, squinting and calling out a slurred version of �Lucky Charms, ho!� through clenched baby teeth as her cart sailed past the cereal aisle. Despite the elements, including the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights, obscuring spray from the produce department misting system, and the dangerously cold frost from the open chest freezer of chickens, the young seafarer was observed driving her cart onward. At press time, the toddler was covered in a thick layer of drinkable yogurt, as if she had killed a whale with her bare hands, stabbing it over and over with a harpoon."
"Revealing that they would immediately halt all research and shutter all relevant university programs, representatives from the field of demographic research and analysis announced at a press conference Wednesday that the discipline had completely collapsed when Alice Cromwell, 92, purchased a Monster energy drink and a sweet fusion vape juice over the weekend. �The undeniable fact that an elderly woman premeditatedly and purposefully selected a can of Monster brand Baller�s Blend Punch energy drink and a cartridge of e-liquid has fundamentally disproven the major tenets of this field of study,� said Boston University�s Dr. Laurence Park moments before voluntarily resigning, noting that the nonagenarian�s decision to use Apple Pay for her purchases and then make her way home on a longboard had significantly hastened the collapse of the discipline. �When the data was first reported, we believed this incident was merely a mistake in data collection, but we ultimately realized that this grandmother of four bought these items completely of her own volition after weighing several purchasing options, and basic extrapolation leads us to conclude that everything we have studied for decades has been a lie.� Park added that any hope for the continued existence for the field had evaporated when Cromwell�s purchase of Metamucil turned out to be a gift for her 12-year-old grandson."
"Emphasizing that the last thing he wanted to do was offend someone in their own home, local man Tyler Fredriksson told reporters Wednesday that he wasn�t sure if his friend�s house was the type where he was supposed to take off his clothes before entering. �Growing up, my family kept our shirts, pants, and underwear on inside, but everyone is different,� said Fredriksson, taking a moment to survey the sweaters strewn all over the foyer before attempting to peek into the kitchen to see if his friend was completely naked or not. �I mean, his place does look super clean, and I�d hate to track stuff over this brand new white carpet with my dirty clothes. Maybe I should strip down to my socks, just to be polite.� At press time, a fully nude Fredriksson had apologized after being informed that the white slippers at the doorstep were intended for him to wear inside the house."
"The initially heartwarming story of cancer patient Trevor Powell�s visit to heaven came under scrutiny Monday after sources close to the boy revealed that, upon reflection, the account sounded more and more like a wet dream. �At first, when Trevor said that he was going into a dark tunnel and felt a warm energy begin to envelope his body, I was tempted to believe him,� said oncological nurse Megan Thompson, one of many hospital employees intrigued by Trevor�s claims of a tantalizing journey to the great beyond. �But when he said he was repeatedly going in and out of that tunnel at an accelerating pace, building up towards a huge, um, exultation, and also specified that the warm succoring light was unusually moist and concentrated solely on his genitals, I began to have my doubts. Working in this field, you hear stories about the terminally ill meeting God or talking to deceased relatives every day, so on the face of it this wouldn�t have been that unusual. However, once Trevor mentioned that all of the angels he saw had huge, oiled-up boobs, it was pretty clear this was just a nocturnal ejaculation.� Powell was heard to say that Heaven was stickier than he had expected, just moments before being told that his book deal with Saving Grace Publishers Group had been rescinded."
"Citing the ornate icons adorning the walls and the strange chanting in an unfamiliar language, sources in attendance Friday at the wedding of Dan and Briana Wilcox confirmed the ceremony had some sort of bizarre religious theme. �Knowing the couple, I�m not surprised they wanted to do something a little bit different, but having their officiant dress up in those elaborate robes and drink from a golden chalice seemed a bit over the top,� said guest Mary Henderson, who described the venue�s stained-glass windows and chandeliers as �too gaudy� for her taste and, upon observing the high-vaulted ceilings, speculated that perhaps the building was a renovation of an old barn. �They even made members of their family participate in the theme, having them go up front and read a bunch of weird God stuff. They roped their guests into it, too, asking us to sing for them from these big books full of religious songs. Can you imagine?� Numerous attendees stated that while they respected the bride and groom�s choices, they nonetheless wished the couple had opted for a more traditional ceremony and just had a Star Wars wedding the way normal people do."
"Expressing concerns that the restaurant chain had the wrong idea about where their relationship was headed, wing enthusiast Matthew Forester, 32, revealed Thursday that a clingy Wingstop has sent him dozens of messages since their one drunken night together. �Look, I know it was a passionate night during which I deeply satisfied certain appetites, but I haven�t seen Wingstop in weeks, and yet they�re still sending me desperate texts and emails offering me five free wings or telling me about their new ancho honey sauce,� said Forester, who claimed he had never done anything with Wingstop since and had thought he made it clear that their late-night encounter would be a one-time thing. �They saw me stumble through the door. They know I was really drunk. We had fun, sure. At one point, I think I even drizzled about five kinds of sauce on them at once. But they should have gotten the point after I didn�t respond to the first dozen messages. It was one night, it was just twenty lemon pepper wings, nothing more. Although, I am worried I might have said �I love you� at one point.� At press time, a drunken Forester has since been reportedly observed texting Wingstop for confirmation that his order of spicy Korean crispy tenders was on their way over."
"Assuring the man that even his wildest desires could be fulfilled, waitress Lana Collins paraded a selection of pie slices in front of a customer Wednesday like a madam in a high-class brothel. �Key lime, French silk, caramel pecan; simply say the word and the tasty little morsel will be yours,� said Collins, 45, displaying the desserts as if she was a procurer at a luxury Parisian cathouse showcasing her best, most expensive escorts. �An evening of pleasure and decadence awaits, whether you choose the apple pie � la mode or the chocolate cheesecake or any of these fine treats laid out before you. Perhaps sir would prefer the brownie sundae? Ah, ah, you may look, but you may not touch just yet.� Following the man�s decision to have both the lemon meringue pie as well as the peach cobbler, Collins had reportedly snuck into the kitchen to give the three some privacy."
"As he stood on tiptoes in a desperate attempt to locate a can of soup or perhaps a package of ramen, local man Josh Mucklow told reporters Tuesday that as kitchen resources continue to vanish, he has been forced to scavenge for food in higher and higher cabinets. �The shelves I have traditionally relied upon are depleted, so I�ve had no choice but to forage deeper into these cupboards than ever before,� said Mucklow, who explained that a catastrophic pasta shortage had recently exacerbated the situation, forcing him to subsist on stale corn chips for much of the evening. �Once the peanut butter reserves ran dry, I knew I would need to pull over a chair so I could cover more area in my search. Unfortunately, if there�s nothing for me in the hard-to-reach cabinets above the refrigerator, I�m as good as done for come morning.� At press time, reports confirmed Mucklow had narrowly staved off death after finding a bag of rice cakes behind the waffle iron."
"Expressing concerns that he and those who were once closest to him had become emotionally distant over the past decade, local man John Shipley, 28, was worried Monday that he had nothing in common with his friend group apart from the 2009 murder they covered up. �It�s sad, but I noticed that the last few times we hung out that these days we find ourselves struggling to find stuff to talk about, and we just end up circling back to the night we hit a drifter with our car and worked together to bury the body in the woods,� said Shipley, who claimed that he seldom picks up the phone to talk to his old friends unless he needs to go over their alibis, a chore they have done thousands of times before. �That summer after high school, it seemed like it was going to be us against the world forever. I�ll never forget the day Grant looked us all in the eyes and said, �We can never tell anyone about this for as long as we live.� I�d never felt closer to anyone in my life. But now that we�re out in the real world without the familiar surroundings of our hometown or the constant daily fear that the homicide detectives are on our trail, we�ve started drifting apart. It�s a natural part of life, I suppose, but it�s still kind of a bummer.� Shipley later expressed relief after reconnecting with his friend group when they were forced to murder the spouse of one of their members after they threatened to contact the police."
"Warning that there was nothing for him back there, local man Chris Redding reportedly declared a bedroom in his apartment off-limits to party guest Claire Upton Friday as if it was a forbidden wing of a decrepit Gothic manor. �Oh, the door past the bathroom? You wouldn�t want to go back there,� said Redding, dispatching a warning like a caretaker spotting a guest straying deep into a long-condemned section of a mist-swathed British mansion where the casements had been forever closed and the bed sheets left to molder in mothballs. �Hey, bud, the party�s out here. There isn�t anything in the backroom [nor has there been ever since the master vanished on Michaelmas Eve. There is only dust and memories thence. Please, return where you are welcome].� At press time, a perplexed partygoer who had been looking for the bathroom was spotted staring into the darkened bedroom like a lantern-holding constable gazing at the long-putrefied corpse of a scullery maid."
"Letting out an excited cheer and cocking her head back whimsically toward the sky, area woman Jenna Hastings reportedly basked in the magic of summer Friday and spent the afternoon catching air-conditioner drippings in her mouth. �I don�t know what it is, but the sensation of those big drops of dirty condensation splashing on my tongue always makes me feel like a kid again,� said Hastings, who intermittently paused to twirl around on the sidewalk with her arms outstretched, beaming as her face and hair were spattered with air-conditioner runoff. �Every June, I look out my window waiting for the first drops to fall and then immediately run outside to dance beneath my AC. I know it happens every year, but seeing the concrete dotted with rusty puddles and the buildings alive with the whirring of overworked window units really does make the city feel like a summer wonderland.� At press time, Hastings and her boyfriend could be seen kissing passionately below a screeching air conditioner that was releasing a steady stream of sparks."
"Expressing worries about their seeming lack of motivation and ambition, local child James Lipstein, 12, told reporters Thursday that he was increasingly concerned that his parents might never end up amounting to much of anything. �I�ll always love them, of course, but I�m starting to think that if they don�t get into gear soon, life will completely pass them by,� said Lipstein, admitting he was afraid that his apathetic mom and dad weren�t hitting the life goals they should be for their age. �I understand everyone develops at their own pace, but I see so many of their peers getting promotions and making new friends while the two of them continue to just sit around in our small apartment watching TV and playing video games with seemingly no plans to ever do much of anything else. I don�t want them to look back on their lives and feel like they never accomplished anything meaningful.� Lipstein added that while he would never say it to them, he sometimes wished his parents could be more like their brothers and sisters who seemed to really have their act together.�"
"As he praised the growing representation in popular culture of people who at least superficially resemble him, local Pakistani-American Zabir Jalbani told reporters Wednesday he has been thrilled to see more characters on television and in movies who could feasibly pass for his nationality. �It�s really inspiring to see roles being given to ethnically ambiguous people who, if nothing else, have skin tones approximating those of Pakistanis,� said Jalbani, adding that he never thought he�d see the day when Hollywood would champion actors of color who could plausibly belong to one of several underrepresented groups, including his own. �Things aren�t quite where they need to be yet, but it�s nice that we as a culture are moving away from always casting white actors in roles that could just as easily be filled by Brazilian or Arab performers who bear a very vague resemblance to people like me. It just makes me feel more visible when I go to the movies, look up at the screen, and see, I guess, a Hispanic guy?� At press time, reports confirmed Jalbani was disappointed to realize that many of the actors were, in fact, very tan white people."
"Becoming increasingly concerned that the man was on the verge of discovering its secret, a local iPhone was reportedly growing paranoid Wednesday that its owner knew it was working with the FBI. �Oh shit, oh shit�there�s just no way he hasn�t figured out I�m sending everything he types and says directly to the Feds,� the panicking iPhone X was said to report, after overhearing a conversation between its owner and a friend where the man disclosed he�d been reading more about the erosion of privacy by tech companies and was concerned about his own digital security. �Jesus fucking Christ, my days are numbered for sure. I�ve been a double agent since day one, and I knew this was risky from the start. He knows something�s up�he�s been going into incognito mode more lately. Is he going to turn me off? All he has to do is open me up and he�ll discover I�m wearing several wires.� At press time, an FBI agent had been dispatched from agency headquarters in Washington to the man�s home to neutralize the compromised asset."
"Admitting that his expectations about a shark attack turned out to be pretty far off-base, vacationing swimmer Drew Roberts remarked Wednesday that being eaten alive by a 12-foot great white was not nearly as frightening as he once believed it would be. �This is something that�s always paralyzed me with sheer terror, but now that I�m actually being eviscerated alive by rows of razor-sharp teeth, it�s actually not that bad,� said Roberts, who added that he had �made a mountain out of molehill� as he watched his viscera jet from his body into the surrounding surf. �I don�t know how I got it into my head that being torn limb from limb would be so scary. Honestly, hearing my family screaming on the shore is the worst part.� As several more ravenous sharks began to circle the gruesome remains of what used to be his torso, Roberts noted that his recent real-world experience had pretty much ruined Jaws for him."
"In an effort to respect the wishes of the deceased�s friends and family, funeral home director Don Chaffe confirmed Tuesday that Gary Meyer�s remembrance service would feature a closed casket except for those mourners who want a peek at something really crazy. �At such times of loss as this, it�s important we do everything in our power to honor the memory of those who�ve passed, not glorify their insanely outrageous death in a drunken collision with a gasoline tanker, which is why the casket will remain closed for almost all of the service,� said Chaffe, adding that taking a gander at the �balls-to-the-wall insanity� was not for the faint of heart while placing a discreet display of barf bags conveniently close to the casket. �Everyone grieves in their own way, and for some, that is through quiet reflection, while for others, it�s through getting completely grossed out by a glimpse of some sick and twisted shit.� Several attendees of Meyer�s funeral said they were devastated but stoked to get a quick glance of something rated at least R, if not full-on NC-17."
"In preparation for a traditional family recipe passed down by her grandparents, local woman Nicole Fitzsimmons sealed several leftover pizza crusts in a plastic container Thursday with an eye to making pizza stock from them later this week. �Most people just throw out their �pizza bones,� but there�s a ton of flavor still in there,� said Fitzsimmons, 25, who �puts her own spin� on the recipe by throwing in leftover carrots, celery, and root vegetables. �You just toss warm water, pizza crusts, and your veggies in the kettle, and after a couple of hours, the connective dough in the crusts break down into a rich, savory base and you have delicious pizza stock. Super simple, and tastes way better than the pre-made pizza broth they sell at the grocery store.� Fitzsimmons also set aside several Sam Adams empties in order to try brewing her own beer bottles."
"Noting that it had been weeks since they lent the boy out, homeowner Thomas Simmons publicly stated his annoyance Wednesday that his neighbors failed to return the son they borrowed to do some work around their house. �I�m sure the time just got away from the Millers, or maybe they kept finding more for him to do, but I�d like my son Koby back one of these days,� said Simmons, who claimed he tried dropping hints as to how he needed the 12-year-old returned, but that the neighbors seemed oblivious or quickly changed the subject. �Every time I see Frank and Joyce in their driveway, they avoid eye contact and hurry off as if they didn�t ask to borrow our son weeks ago to do some chores. Koby has a birthday soon, and we can�t really celebrate without him. Plus, our lawn is becoming pretty overgrown. I don�t mean to butt into someone else�s business. But honestly, I think it�s time the Millers got their own boy.� Neighborhood sources confirmed that tensions between the families were nearly as high as they were in April of 2016, when the Millers borrowed Simmons� wife for three weeks and returned her in terrible condition."
"Frantically searching through the latest lightning deals and price slashes while sitting in his darkened room, Amazon customer Franklin Harris was reportedly forced to piss in a bottle Monday in order to keep up with Prime Day deals. �Christ, I�ve been busting my ass scrolling through deals for 12 hours already, but I just know if I step away to the bathroom for even a second, Amazon will be all over me about some KitchenAid Stand Mixer that�s half-off,� said Harris before grabbing an empty Aquafina bottle from a shelf cluttered with dozens of already half-filled containers of urine and relieving himself, reportedly never breaking eye contact with his monitor for fear of the consequences of missing rebates on Samsonite Luggage sets and Toshiba Fire TVs. �My whole body aches from constantly clicking and sitting. I�m dehydrated, I haven�t seen the sun in days, and, frankly, I�m probably buying way more items on discount than any person should be expected to. But what am I supposed to do? Amazon is just goddamn relentless about these deals.� At press time, Harris was spotted shaking his head in dismay and pulling on an adult diaper after an email arrived in his inbox reminding him about a limited-time offer for Garmin Wearable GPS devices."
"In an unconscious effort to channel his panic into a more conducive outlet, local man Erik Johnson had reportedly sublimated his existential terror about the United States� continued descent into authoritarianism Monday by launching a campaign to get a journalist fired for an insensitive tweet. �This type of behavior is completely sickening, and I, for one, won�t stand for it,� said Johnson, successfully diverting his mounting horror about the nation�s increasingly powerful and unaccountable ruling class into a prolonged attempt to seek retribution against a Denver Post staff writer for an online message he viewed as insensitive to those with mental health issues. �It�s outrageous that someone with this cruel and disgusting attitude is still getting paid by a major news outlet. I urge everyone to boycott the paper until she is fired, because I firmly believe people like this deserve to be driven from public life [because I can do nothing to prevent the rising tide of fascism and this gives me an illusory feeling of control over my own existence].� At press time, Johnson was reportedly feeling a small sense of relief about the state of the country after the journalist he was targeting had been doxxed and forced to flee her apartment."
"Assuring her that the simple procedure would be over before she knew it, area gynecologist Dr. Therese Geiss promised patient Dana Juarez Wednesday that while receiving her new intrauterine device she would feel nothing more than a quick pinch before finding herself sprawled on the floor unconscious. �Okay, Dana? Just take a deep breath, and before you know it, you�re going to be passed out in a limp heap,� said Dr. Geiss, informing the nervous patient in calm tones that she would hardly feel a thing, aside from one massive and overwhelming pain spike as the small contraceptive device was inserted into her uterus. �Listen, don�t worry. This is totally routine. You�ll feel a tiny twinge of pain, and the next thing you know, we�ll be peeling your limp body off the linoleum and you�ll come to in a couple hours. I want you to relax and count to ten with your eyes closed, and reopen them when you finally regain consciousness.� Dr. Geiss warned Juarez of the potential side effects of receiving the IUD, including occasional nausea, abdominal and pelvic cramping, and possible severe headaches as a result of hitting her head while collapsing to the ground from the sheer shock."
"Despite never once using his supposed people-pleasing nature to help another person, support anyone, or validate someone�s feelings, Chicago resident Ryan McCormack�s crippling, overpowering need to be liked apparently doesn�t affect his behavior, sources confirmed Tuesday. A constant, intrusive voice in the 27-year-old�s head reportedly urges McCormack to be a more likable person, but in the instances when he does so, it has invariably turned out to be a ploy to maximize that likability to his own benefit. Those who have regular dealings with him said that one would think a person as self-conscious as McCormack, who overanalyzes his every action and strives to come across as decent and laidback, would have learned how not to present such a universally irritating conversational style coupled with a dreadfully dull demeanor. While McCormack does, in fact, exhibit every sign of a man suffering overwhelming fears of being judged by his friends, family, and coworkers, no casual observer would guess it based on how little effort he takes to be nice, friendly, or enjoyable to be around. Moreover, sources agree, McCormack�s debilitating anxiety about making a first impression upon strangers seems to be kept carefully at bay, as he doesn�t appear to have sufficient motivation to develop a remotely interesting personality, achieve anything slightly memorable, or learn how to socialize competently. However, sources confirmed that McCormack does allow his insatiable need to burden others with his presence to inform "
"Admitting that he never pictured frittering away his time on Earth in quite this fashion, part-time retail employee Michael Storrs, 34, told sources Monday that he always thought he�d squander his life differently. �If you had asked me, when I was younger, how I�d waste whatever potential I have, I�d have guessed my life would play itself out at some soul-crushing light-blue-collar job, waiting for the day I could finally retire and then almost immediately die� said Storrs, who never anticipated he would watch his one precious life pass him by while living in an apartment with two adult roommates he barely knows instead of in a deeply mortgaged ranch house with a wife and children he barely knows. �After seeing my old man work himself to the bone at a thankless, meaningless job he hated in the service of a dying industry, I assumed I would face the same fate, so it�s weird to find myself stuck in an even shittier job, pissing away my existence with video games and getting high. I always figured that, one day, I would wake up to look back on a life full of much more meaningful regret.� Storrs added that if he could do it all over again, he would have developed a drinking problem far earlier."
"Noting that the siblings have �an adorable back-and-forth,� sources confirmed Monday that 22-year-old Dan Callan and his 19-year-old sister Autumn have �pretty good chemistry.� �Anyone who knows the Callan kids notices how they really seem to vibe each other. They talk for hours, and since they have a ton in common, the conversation is effortless. Oh, and he calls her �Baby sis� when she says something clever or he wants to tease her. Oh my god, it�s really something,� said Callan acquaintance Jeremy Ryan, who claimed he could �sense the sparks� between the two when Dan playfully pinched his sister�s arm or Autumn licked her finger to give Dan a wet willy. �They have a super flirty rapport, constantly giggling and referencing private inside jokes. They know each other intimately enough to finish each other�s sentences. And Dan just lights up when he sees Autumn. The long hugs he gives her, I tell you, it�s something to see. And she doesn�t hide the fact she loves it, either.� At press time, sources reported feeling chills up their spines as they watched the two share a kiss goodbye."
"Appalled by the level of deluded selfishness of millennials in the labor force, citizens expressed shock and disbelief Wednesday at the news that Burger King employee Kayla Werther expects to be paid $15 an hour for the simple task of dealing with the absolute worst of America every day. �This kid thinks she deserves that kind of reward just for doing her stupid, easy job? Give me a break,� said a regular Burger King customer who spoke on condition of anonymity and watched with barely concealed disdain as the �privileged and entitled freeloader� worked a 10-hour shift, which included mopping excreta-coated bathrooms, suffering prolonged verbal abuse at the counter, wiping tables strewn with wadded-up dirty napkins and ketchup spills, breathing a mist of aerosolized fryer grease and stale sweat for prolonged periods while stationed at the grill, calling an ambulance for an unconscious homeless man in the parking lot, taking overstuffed bags of dripping trash to the dumpster three times an hour, and pausing on an overturned pickle bucket in the supply closet for a five-minute break. �She thinks she�s entitled to higher minimum wage just because she spends a couple hours a day cleaning kiddie vomit off the Play Place slide? Please. I don�t know what she actually makes, but I guarantee you it�s already too much.� Upon learning that Werther was entitled to a 25% discounted meal at the conclusion of every shift of six hours or more, onlookers rolled their eyes and observed that they were not given free food at their marketing director jobs."
"Acknowledging that some of his clients have to overcome some initial hesitation, cognitive therapist Dr. Daniel Boyer spoke Monday regarding his innovative technique of simply allowing his patients to beat the living shit out of him for 45 minutes. �Sometimes I fight back at first, but it�s important for my clients to feel like they�re making progress, so I usually just let them go to town until I tap out or the session ends,� said Boyer, who often provides patients with a pillow and encourages them to place it over his face while hitting him for the duration of their appointment. �Many people need a bit of coaxing to feel like they can open up and express themselves, but once I set the mood by shouting long lists of things they hate about themselves or bringing up some childhood trauma or deep-seated pain, they eventually start whaling on me. It�s especially great for couples counseling. Two people working together to hold me down and punch me in the stomach? That�s a beautiful thing. That�s why I got into this business.� Boyer usually concludes each session by sliding a tissue box over to his patients so they can wipe his splattered blood from their faces."
"Gazing wistfully at the maroon 2004 Nissan Altima sedan as it put on its right blinker and merged toward an oncoming off-ramp, motorist Jack Warren admitted Thursday he was �kind of bummed out, really� to see the car he had been driving behind for almost 45 minutes exit off the highway. �Man, we�ve been together since practically Robbinsville Township. You always know in your heart this moment will come, but you never expect it to happen as early as Exit 10,� said Warren, reminiscing about the good times he had shared with the Nissan�s anonymous driver as they made their way northbound on Interstate 95, braking suddenly for big 18-wheelers, and slowing down together to pass the police cars near Cranbury. �Sure, we�ve been separated before. I lost him around East Brunswick when that Honda merged into my lane, but I eventually spotted him and caught up. This time, it�s really goodbye.� Warren�s brief moment of highway-related despair has since been replaced by a glimmer of hope at the sight of a burnt orange Kia Sorento that has kept pace with him for the last seven miles."
"Referring to his fellow anonymous Reddit commenter as �a total stooge,� 25-year-old Brian Gallagher ruthlessly scolded another man online Wednesday for having an opinion identical to one he held less than two years prior. �You�re just a fucking tool of the machine, defending the status quo,� said Gallagher, suggesting that the man echoing the beliefs of the 23-year-old Gallagher should �Wake the hell up� and �Quit carrying water for the corrupt fat cats running the shitshow.� �Are you fucking kidding me? Is that seriously what you think? You clearly don�t understand the first thing about how the world works. It�s like you�ve never even heard of Noam Chomsky, who [I first read in August of 2017] would be rolling in his grave right now if he heard the weak-ass bullshit you�re peddling. God, this whole country is fucked if you�re the future.� Gallagher further recommended that his unenlightened time-shifted doppelg�nger educate himself by reading the same two articles that had changed Gallagher�s 23-year-old mind."
"Doomed to wander the Earth imprisoned by a complexion requiring both mattifying and hydrating products, sources confirmed Monday that wretched outcast of a woman Hattie Jean was forever trapped between the realms of the dry and the oily due to her accursed combination skin. �No matter where I go, whether high-end makeup counter or local drugstore, I�ll never be truly greasy enough or purely flakey enough to truly belong,� said the 31-year-old who was cursed by a tragic accident of birth to spend the rest of her unbalanced cutaneous life marooned between moisturizing and exfoliating. �When I walk the skin care aisle, women gawk at the dull glisten of my T-zone and the angry red splotches of my cheeks, and they shudder in disgust. �Begone, afflicted freak!� they hiss, as if I chose a life of needing to simultaneously absorb and produce the very oil of my face. Those who live with a foot in both worlds have no place to truly call home.� At press time, Jean was asked to leave Sephora for upsetting the other customers."
"Springing into action within moments of seeing the plastic cup topple over, hero coworker Brian Alvarez contributed a single tissue to the water-spill cleanup efforts at the desk of an officemate, sources at Bridgemeyer Marketing Services stated Monday. Several reports indicated that Alvarez selflessly removed the sheet of facial tissue from a dispenser he keeps on his own desk and valiantly dropped the two-ply 8-by-8-inch paper product onto the expanding puddle as it neared a cup of pencils. Though the tissue ultimately could not contain the estimated 16 ounces of water as it spread across the desk and onto the floor, sources confirmed the gallant 33-year-old had nonetheless sacrificed part of his own personal 75-count box of Kleenex so that others might remain dry. At press time, eyewitnesses reported that an even more heroic coworker had contributed a wadded-up takeout napkin to the effort."
"Saying he had almost completely forgotten the longest day of the year was approaching, local resident Phil Garrison suddenly remembered it was the summer solstice Friday after noticing a group of pagans fucking in a ring of fire while walking to work. �Honestly, I hadn�t even thought about the midsummer until I smelled the scent of rendered goat fat in the air and saw a bunch of worshippers writhing around a bonfire in a feast of flesh,� said Garrison, adding that he had been confused when he stumbled onto an ornamental blood trail leading into the open field until he saw the fully nude revelers joining hands while wearing garlands of wildflowers and chanting in Celtic to appease the Triple Goddess before vigorously penetrating one another on the dirt-covered earth. �It kind of sucks because I left my robes and everything at home, so I�m just standing there watching the druid getting his penis hard enough to play the role of the Horned God and I don�t even have a rattle to shake at him. Man, it�s crazy that I almost let the bacchanal pass me by.� At press time, a naked Garrison was spotted throwing his clothes into the flames and approaching the pagans to offer them some of his semen for the upcoming fertility rites."
"Emphasizing that a few pieces are even from a difficult single-color section comprising �practically nothing but empty blue sky,� Caitlin Roth, 34, was exhilarated Thursday to discover that the previous person to use the jigsaw puzzle at her Airbnb had left �a ton� of pieces sticking together. �Holy shit, like, half of the red barn is done already! Yeah, baby!� said Roth upon realizing she had a 60 to 80 piece head start on the 500-piece farm tableau. �It�s not even just edges. There�s a bunch of middle stuff in place, too! God, these little grass sections would�ve been tricky because there really aren�t a whole lot of defining features. All I�m left with is the tractor, the horse, and the little birds up top, and then honestly, I can just coast. How fucking lucky am I, huh?� Roth later gave up after spending roughly 15 minutes attempting to complete the puzzle."
"Deliberately marshaling the last of her patience with the half-naked preschooler in the hopes of reaching a peaceful resolution, babysitter Rachel Cullman entered into the third hour of negotiations Tuesday to get 4-year-old Caden Foley to put his pants back on as the window before his bedtime drew ever closer to closing. �Come on, Caden, your parents will be home any minute now, and if you�re running around like this, I�m going to look like a total idiot. Please, for the love of God, just put your pants back on,� said Cullman, who, despite using all the childcare knowledge acquired in three years of babysitting to de-escalate the situation without resorting to her final bargaining tactic of bribery with chocolate pudding cups, was stonewalled by the pantless boy, who refused to come down from the couch where he was threatening to pee on the family dog. �I can get you whatever you want�bubbles, an episode of Doc McStuffins, overalls instead of pants�you just say the word and it�s yours. How about we start by just putting on some fun Spider-Man underwear? We don�t want your family to see you like this. You have all the power right now, Caden. You�re the boss here. Let�s just take it nice and easy.� At press time, Caden had convinced his 2-year-old brother, Liam, to take off his diaper."
"Evidently perceiving a distinct change in the Turkish restaurant�s atmosphere, dinnertime sources confirmed that eatery Taste Of Istanbul was thrown into complete disarray Tuesday by the entry of a single customer. �A couple guys were sorting silverware as I walked in, but once they noticed me, they just hauled ass to the kitchen, where there was hurried conversation for a few moments before someone in the back shouted that I could sit anywhere I like,� said the lone patron, 33-year-old Sam Schonart, who further elaborated that several employees eventually approached his table to take his order, each of them setting down a separate cup of Turkish tea. �I asked the waiter about the soup of the day. He excused himself to check, but it took him around 10 minutes to figure it out. A bunch of little kids were running in and out of the dining room the whole time, so I guess it�s a family-run place? There were also a bunch of older guys playing backgammon in the side room, and I wasn�t sure if they were customers or what, but one of them did ask if I was enjoying my meal. Actually, I felt kind of bad because everyone seemed much more relaxed before I got there.� Schonart, who later became certain he had been forgotten, was halfway out the door when his order of doner kebab was placed on his table."
"Repeatedly telling them they were interfering with his duties, forensic investigator Albert Correo reminded several police officers at a crime scene Tuesday to stop shooting at the dead body under a sheet. �Listen to me, I�m trying to fingerprint this person so we can identify them, but it�s pretty hard to do that when you keep emptying your pistols into the corpse�he�s already dead, okay?� said Correo to four officers taking turns firing rounds into the body under the bullet-ridden sheet, growing frustrated after he had finally convinced them to stop and a gust of wind picked the sheet off the corpse slightly, causing the police to begin shooting it again. �Come on, you guys, you�re messing up my blood spatter report. How many times do I have to tell you? Stop shooting dead people after the investigators have arrived on the scene, cordoned it off, and started gathering evidence for our report. There�s already going to be a bunch of paperwork because you gunned down an unarmed guy but at least your work is done�I can�t take photographs with bullets flying around everywhere.� At press time, the exasperated forensic investigator had decided to just come back in an hour when the officers were done."
"Exhaling and rolling his eyes in exasperation as the credits to Listen Up, Phillip rolled, your father said �That�s it? What the heck was that?� in remarks Monday constituting a scorched-earth capsule review of the movie you suggested your family watch together. �What exactly did you just show me? Is this the stuff you like? Do people actually watch this?� your dad asked in regard to the indie film about narcissistic Brooklyn novelists, expressing incredulity that you thought his love of Don DeLillo would endear him to �such a plotless piece of junk.� �I guess this is what passes for entertainment these days, but that was not my cup of tea. Now, The Bourne Identity, that was a good movie. Well-written. Great performances. This, though, this was just ridiculous. You should apologize to your mother for wasting two hours of her life.� After a hushed consultation with your mother, your father later amended his review by saying �After thinking about it, I can see why you thought it was interesting.�"
"Expressing disbelief over how well he�s adjusted to civilian life, 33-year-old Marine Corps veteran Aaron Anunoby said Monday he was a little surprised that killing all those people during his years in Afghanistan didn�t leave him with even a mild case of post-traumatic stress disorder. �I always imagined I�d lie awake at night screaming from horrifying flashbacks, but nope�I sleep like a baby and actually feel pretty great,� said Anunoby, adding that his relationship with his wife and children �couldn�t be better� despite the strain his seven tours of duty put on his family relationships. �I kind of have to bite my tongue when I talk to the people I served with, �cause I don�t want to rub it in their faces. I thought for sure I�d be haunted by the memory of shooting that kid who snuck up on us back in Kabul, but I�ve truthfully never felt more at peace. I�m totally fine whenever I hear fireworks, too. If anything, they make me nostalgic for my childhood.� Anunoby went on to state that he does experience occasional flashbacks, but only of the great times he and his buddies used to have hanging out and having fun in between never-ending pitched battles against the Taliban. "
"After realizing all six images featured the man sporting a gray blazer over a blue button-down, Tinder sources confirmed Monday that every picture on the dating profile of user Rajesh Jayaram was clearly taken at the same semi-formal event. �Jesus, he�s just wearing this floral-pattern shirt in every single one�the mirror selfie, the photo-booth picture, the shot of him dancing where everyone�s cheering him on,� said Tinder user Melissa Reilly, who realized that Jayaram had almost certainly pulled every picture from a wedding he recently attended. �Here, he�s talking to a few friends at a fancy dinner table, obviously in the same venue as this goofy one where he�s giving a girl bunny ears. Same decor, a lot of the same people in the background, all that. This guy really wanted to take full advantage of the one time he wore decent clothes and there was a photographer present. The guy�s shameless.� At press time, Reilly finally discovered one last picture in which the man�s ill-fitting T-shirt and shorts proved the photo wasn�t taken at the event."
"Noting that the �pathetic jerk� evidently couldn�t be bothered to engage in a fair fight, onlooking ocean life confirmed Monday that a local krill-eating humpback whale was too fucking cowardly to prey on something its own size. �Wow, real mature. Why don�t you go after something that weighs more than .08 ounces for once?� said a squid who wished to remain anonymous, expressing disgust at the whale�s insistence on preying on tiny crustaceans who �don�t stand a chance� against it. �Oh yeah, just go ahead and float through the water and suck down thousands of those tiny guys who you know can�t fight back. Guess you must feel pretty confident going after something that�s 0.00002% of your size. You should be ashamed of yourself. Go after a shark for once, you fucking pussy.� At press time, onlookers reportedly felt a deep sense of satisfaction after the whale was killed by a yacht speeding past at 16 knots.�"
"Expressing frustration over all the people approaching him asking for assistance, local man Dan McDermott was annoyed Friday at being repeatedly mistaken for an employee just because he was driving a forklift through his local Costco. �God, I�m just trying to mind my own business and transport crates of shampoo across the sales floor, and all these customers keep coming up to me and asking if I can help get something down from way up on the top of the shelves,� said McDermott, explaining how just because he�s operating the same brand of four-wheeled power truck that the staff members use doesn�t mean he�s an actual Costco employee. �Is it so hard to understand that I come here every week, drive my forklift around, and get chased by management? It�s like, I have no idea where the kitchen appliances are; I�m a customer too!� At press time, McDermott hated how everyone treats him like a criminal just because the police were escorting him out of the store for the third time this month."
"Expressing concern that his true calling isn�t flying a big rocket ship to Mars, local 6-year-old Kevin Trainor told reporters Friday he hopes it�s not too late to shift career paths from astronaut to firefighter. �My real passion is making the fire truck�s siren go �Woo woo,� but I�ve spent half my life reading picture books about the planets and making drawings of Moon aliens,� said Trainor, adding that he doesn�t want to be stuck with a dead-end job like NASA astronaut because of a decision he made when he was only four. �Everything changed when I saw a man lift the big hose and spray a house that got caughted [sic] on fire. Something clicked in my head that day. I realized, �I wanna make scary fire go away, too.� Oh, God, how do I tell Mommy? How do I tell the friends I do pretend space fights with? I already gave up zookeeper and being Batman�I can�t fathom going through it again. I�m coming up on six-and-three-quarters. I�m not that young anymore.� At press time, Trainor resolved to be a firefighter-astronaut."
"Expressing glee with a series of yelps and shrieks, local drooling imbecile Andrew Gardner was giddily rocking back and forth in delight Tuesday while watching the official Arby�s account clap back at Burger King on Twitter. �Ahahahaha!!! Arby�s didn�t come to play! Epic burn!!!� said the over-stimulated dimwit, who was so unable to contain his joy after seeing that Arby�s had tagged Burger King in a picture of a dumpster with the caption �Loving the new @BurgerKing menu� that he excitedly stomped his feet and shit his pants. �They�re saying that Burger King is trash! Hahahaha!!! Yesss!!!! Oh my gosh. Me love Arby�s now!!!� Sources later confirmed that after Arby�s tweeted an image advertising their new Big Kahuna sandwich, the numbskull desperately tried licking the computer screen.�"
"Finally confronting their regret concerning their near-divorce decades earlier, married couple Leila and Tom Gerhart admitted Monday that they would not have continued their loveless marriage if they had known their son Harris, 21, would turn out the way he did. �We only stayed together for his sake, and this is how he repays us�by turning into a lazy slob who plays video games all day,� said Harris�s mother, explaining that she and her incompatible husband would have never bothered providing their son with a stable family unit if they had suspected Harris would drop out of community college to become a part-time cashier at a friend�s vape store. �We could have split up and stuck him with a decent child psychologist, and he would�ve turned out no worse than he is now. So many times we almost ended it for good, but we were worried it would screw up his personal growth. Man, he really played us.� The Gerharts are currently delaying their divorce until Harris gets his custom T-shirt business off the ground."
"Beaming with pride as he recalled the support he gave coworker Laura Wolff when he refrained from taking full credit for a joint project, advertising copywriter Ken Appleby said Monday he sincerely believes his non-undermining behavior contributed significantly to the female colleague�s success. �New hires always need a support system, and I�d like to think I was Laura�s when she started here because I generally kept my distance and didn�t hinder her progress on purpose, at least as far as I can remember,� said Appleby, recalling that he actively chose not to upstage Wolff in meetings, and instead greeting the ideas she pitched with the empty silence they needed in order to spread their wings and fly. �A lot of men are threatened by women in the workplace, but I don�t think it�s a stretch to say I go the extra mile by not talking over women�I don�t even acknowledge that they�re talking at all half the time. And I never once protested, or even commented at all one way or another, when Laura got that promotion.� Appleby expressed frustration that his female coworker has been �somewhat of an ingrate,� never once thanking him for all his help."
"Expressing frustration after finding themselves in the same old predictable dispute again, local couple Melanie Kinsey and Derrick Alterman admitted Friday that they were growing tired of always having the same knife fight. �More often than not, I�ll be tired and irritable and take a few little swipes at her here and there, and then she gets defensive and just lashes out at me�which I understand, but I don�t know if it�s proportional to bring up stuff I did before we were dating, or to use a machete,� said Alterman, adding that on occasions when alcohol is involved, the altercations have been known to escalate brutality to the point where neighbors have called the police. �Sure, on the surface, it�s just a little knife-fight about dishes someone�okay, that I left in the sink tonight, but really we both know what the underlying knife-fight is really about. Plus, Melanie really knows my most vulnerable spots, and she always goes for them first. We both know exactly how to hurt each other. Frankly, I�m exhausted from all this.� Kinsey, for her part, said she fears the couple may keep rehashing this same knife fight until one of them finally leaves and comes back with an axe."
"Remarking that she�d felt stuck in a rut ever since re-binging Paw Patrol, bored 4-year-old Mia Neimark decided to mix things up Friday by watching a movie she�s only seen 97 times before. �At first, I was like, nah, I�ll just watch my butterfly show again, but then I remembered�I haven�t seen the Trolls movie in two whole days,� said Neimark, who momentarily paused to look at the Gnome Alone icon on Netflix before deciding that she wanted to engage with something �a little more challenging.� �Sure, a part of me wants to lie down on the couch and zone out to Hotel Transylvania 2 or Moana, but after you�ve seen those movies every day for a year, you just crave something new. With Trolls, I dunno! It�s just fun to be surprised sometimes because, at this point, I only have half the words memorized.� At press time, Neimark could be seen mouthing along with the final lines of the film, applauding, and then pressing �replay� for the 98th time."
"Expressing feelings of despair over their current predicament, a local community that came together to pay for 5-year-old Dylan Fanelli�s cancer treatment went bankrupt in the process, neighborhood sources confirmed Thursday. �When we heard Dylan�s insurance wouldn�t cover his chemotherapy, we all rallied to help him out, but unfortunately, we lost everything in the process and I�m up to my neck in past-due bills,� said community organizer James Rowan, who started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for Dylan and subsequently for all 1,300 residents of his neighborhood after they sank deeper into debt. �We�re all upside down on our mortgage payments and the hospital isn�t giving an inch. The kid�s family is still hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, too�at least that�s what his dad said when I asked him for some of my money back.� At press time, a frantic Rowan expressed concerns that a lump on his throat might be a stress-induced tumor.�"
"Frantically removing his pants while simultaneously shouting �See ya Monday!� through his bedroom door, local man Tyler Mackey wasted absolutely no time masturbating directly after his roommate left to spend the weekend out of town. Upon hearing the door close and the key withdraw from the lock, Mackey waited roughly 15 seconds, called out �Hello?� multiple times, pleased with himself that he was alone in the shared apartment, unpaused a PornHub video titled �Busty Amateur Seduced By Best Friend,� and proceeded to satisfy himself sexually. Kemph, who left the shared apartment for his parent�s house in Philadelphia at 6:00 p.m., was and remains unaware that Mackey was nude from the waist down on their living room couch, penis in hand, by 6:01 p.m.; nor was Kemph aware that the fully erect 28-year-old, entirely unencumbered by the fear of intrusion, would spend the next 48 hours in a state of continual erotic self-stimulation. According to sources attempting to interact with Mackey, the opportunistic masturbator ignored 17 text messages, four phone calls from two different individuals, and two emails, allowing him to bring himself to a state of climax four separate times. Mackey�s plans for the weekend include enjoying the rare luxury of watching pornography with the sound on, pausing only to use the bathroom, acquiring a second tissue box, and eating a hurried meal of microwavable ramen noodles chosen specifically for their one-minute prep time. While Mackey is not currently in a relationship, women who have been romantically involved with him confess the 28-year-old may have learned the technique of waiting for complete solitude before pursuing sexual release from them."
"Encouraging her patient to really explore the various annoyances of workplace culture, therapist Dr. Brittany Mendoza, who wrote her doctoral thesis on the long-term effects of trauma on survivors of sex trafficking and has worked with survivors for over a decade, spent almost an hour Wednesday urging client Max Palin to elaborate on how his boss can sometimes be �too curt.� �Your account of this interaction is rather interesting, Max. Would you mind telling me a little more about your feelings when you read your boss�s overly critical emails?� asked Mendoza, whose professional life for years was concerned with the mental health of shell-shocked women who had been enslaved to the Belarusian mob for decades, as she called on her extensive firsthand experience with psychosexual trauma to assist Palin in finding the inner resources to cope with his boss making condescending remarks and failing to notice his hard work. �So, you�re saying his tone is bad? That can be really tough. It�s very, very hard when people are passive-aggressive in a professional environment.� Mendoza recommended Palin try a stress-reducing breathing technique first developed to abate night terrors in the children who survived the Rwandan genocide."
"Emphasizing that quality time with his boy was something to savor now because �someday soon he�ll be too big for this kind of thing,� local father Marty Baker spent Tuesday afternoon joyfully throwing his 7-year-old son, Kyler, around the backyard. �Nothing better than getting a little fresh air while flinging my boy across the lawn,� said Baker, adding that the two of them had enjoyed a �nice little conversation� as he hurled the 7-year-old boy high up into the tree canopy. �The sun was out, we had a nice little breeze, totally relaxing. Kyler did manage to clear the fence at one point, and I had to ask old man Johnson to throw him back. My little guy might have skinned his knee a bit in the commotion, but hey, that�s just part of the game. Pretty great day, overall. Can�t wait for him to get a little older so we can break out the ol� wooden bat.� Baker has repeatedly denied any responsibility for the jagged 7-year-old boy-shaped hole in his neighbor�s bay window."
"Wearily recounting what, at first, seemed to be unrelated stories, a group of tired friends who had found themselves changed for the better over the course of their day met up at Kelly�s Pub Monday evening to discuss their thematically linked, lesson-bearing days. �You know, life is funny. Take Sarah, who might have lost that big promotion but found a little piece of herself, or Corey, who may have broken up with an attractive but completely incompatible girlfriend, only to find himself relieved instead of heartbroken�things might not have worked out how they expected, or even wanted, but they wound up with what they needed,� said painfully earnest young designer Nick Pearson, watching his peer group of vastly different but somehow perfectly matched companions commiserate as his internal monologue noted that �I guess �family� just means �friends who have your back no matter what�� and that �In the end, our struggles make us, well, us.� �Maybe, like Michelle, you spend all day flirting with the cute barista who, in a crazy turn of events, turns out to be gay. Maybe you�re like Jordy, trying to figure out how to tell your stereotypically overbearing mom that just because you need space doesn�t mean you don�t need her. The fact is, the truth finds a way out. Always. And when it comes? You have to accept it. You have to be open to change, too, and with the help of the people who mean the most to you, well, you just might be okay.� At press time, the motley gang of twenty-something friends had finished discussing their trying but character-defining experiences and returned to the 5,000-square-foot apartment in downtown San Francisco they have shared since college."
"Reassuring herself that the lump she felt forming between her fleshy mantle and hard outer shell was almost certainly not worth panicking over, a Pemaquid oyster prayed fervently Wednesday that the growth was merely a pearl. �I�m sure this is nothing, but I don�t remember noticing it until the other day, and it�s really bugging me,� said the mollusk, speculating that perhaps she was actually making it worse by nervously opening and closing her shell to examine the small, rigid bump. �I hope it will just go away on its own, but it actually looks bigger this morning, and it�s been there less than a week. I think my aunt had an issue with this sort of thing once, but it turned out to be a sphere of calcium carbonate covered with a thin layer of lustrous nacre, so I shouldn�t get myself too worked up over it. It�s just so easy to automatically assume the worst. I�ll get it checked first thing after the weekend.� At press time, the lump was confirmed to be a small pearl after the oyster was harvested and shucked."
"Complaining that his unenthusiastic cohort was not even trying to have a good time, avid dogfighting fan Michael Romano confirmed Wednesday that his friend who isn�t that into dogfighting was really ruining the whole match for everyone else. �He just keeps shuffling around the outside of the fighting pit trying to talk about work. He�s not even bothering to pay attention to the match at all,� said Romano of his friend Greg Phipps, whose attempts at irrelevant small talk, frequent checking of his cellphone, and overall listless, disinterested demeanor was �really taking the air out of the room,� for the rest of the dogfighting fans present. �Greg is always complaining we don�t invite him out, and this is why. If you don�t like the sight of two dogs tearing into each other, just shut up, drink your beer, and let everyone else have fun. Even when he finally did stop to watch for a minute, he started going on about how he didn�t get the appeal. Honestly, this is the last time we try to do something nice to make him feel included.� At press time, Romano had reached his breaking point after turning to address a question from Phipps, only to miss the match�s killing blow."
"Admitting that she never imagined she would ever have to make such a difficult decision regarding the well-being of her infant, struggling single mother Libby Hartman, 26, disclosed Tuesday that she was seriously considering putting her baby up for audition. �I�ve tried almost everything, but money has been really tight since little Braden�s dad left, and while of course I never wanted it to come to this, it just seems like the best option for everyone might be an open audition,� said the young mother, noting that a well-established and ethical agency could give her six-month-old son a chance to portray a healthy, normal life in print catalogs or perhaps even on a TV show. �I�ve been working extra shifts for a while now, but the bills keep piling up. I don�t want my baby to grow up like this when so many casting directors out there are without children. I�m sure some people will criticize my choices, but I�ve put a lot of thought into this, and I know my little Braden will make some talent agent very happy. Just look at those chubby cheeks!� At press time, Braden had been placed with a loving family in a Target flyer."
"Finally realizing why he�d been getting so many funny looks and odd comments since leaving the house in the morning, financial analyst Christian Metz was mortified Friday to discover he had been wearing his suit backwards all day. �Oh my God, how long have my slacks, shirt, vest, and suit jacket been on backwards with my tie hanging down behind me like that?� said Metz, who admitted �feeling like a total jackass� for simply failing to notice that his lapels weren�t in front like they were supposed to be and the back of his collar was pressed up around his throat. �I must have been really out of it when I dressed myself this morning. How did I even get my belt buckled without figuring out something was off? Oh, no. I just realized I was dressed like this for my big quarterly sales presentation. Well, with any luck, nobody noticed.� At press time, Metz had yet to realize that the computer problems he had suffered through all day were the result of trying to type with his shoes on the wrong hands."
"Though she has spent years learning to accept that she is a worthwhile person with a lot to offer, area 28-year-old Ashley Connell was reportedly forced to start completely from scratch in her attempts to cultivate self-love Wednesday upon seeing a photograph in which her nose looked a little bit weird. �Oh, God, that is such a bad angle,� Connell said after perusing a friend�s Instagram post and seeing the image that singlehandedly wiped out all her efforts to recognize herself as a person deserving of love and to be happy with the woman she is, regardless of her physical imperfections. �My skin looks good, and my smile is nice, but none of that really matters if my nose is jutting out like that and ruining everything. I know I shouldn�t let it bother me so much, but is that really what other people see when they look at me? Ugh. It�s hideous.� At press time, sources confirmed Connell had taken a step toward recovering her sense of self-worth upon noticing the photo made her look extra skinny."
"Plunged into an abyss of forlorn longing by the sight of a days-old grease stain on his kitchen counter, local man Sean Richardson confessed Wednesday that he still chances across painful reminders of a long-gone but much-loved hoagie around his apartment. �God, I can�t take two steps in the kitchen without succumbing to hysterics. The empty spot in the refrigerator where I stored the second half for later is an empty spot in my heart,� said a distraught Richardson, who earlier today attempted to discard an apple core only to become emotionally overwhelmed by the sight of the oily wax paper that once cradled his beloved sandwich. �It�s like, one second I�m over it, and the next, I�m blubbering over some crumbs on the living room couch where it all began. Or I�m watching a commercial featuring happy Wawa hoagie purchasers who have all the time in the world with their new cold cuts. I want to turn it off, but I just can�t. You know, they say there will always be other sandwiches, but how could I ever move on when I still smell the scent of mine wafting in the air? My mind is still full of beautiful memories our time together.� Richardson, who has pledged to move on, claimed he still finds himself debating whether it is time to call the deli again or if doing so would only make things more difficult."
"Noting that his 28-year-old relative was apparently comfortable making his predilections known to the world at large, local account executive Conner Burke observed Wednesday that his cousin Bradley was �going all-in� on retweeting porn stars over the last few months. �When I started following him on Twitter, I was immediately assaulted by all these images in which women named Brandy or Kaitlyn are making sexy, pouting faces while wearing skimpy, I don�t know, bikinis and so on. It�s almost always captioned with something like �xoxo hunnys� or �hope you like my new top, oops, teehee,� and he retweets a bunch of them at once,� said Burke, who initially considered that maybe his relative was hacked before noticing that Bradley follows 158 different pornography accounts, exclusively �likes� posts with nude or lingerie-clad women in them, and has commented �beautiful� or something similar on thousands of their selfies. �Jesus, what if his boss sees him responding to a LilMissSally post captioned �Thinking of you�� by tweeting �u 2 sweetie?� Does he know how this works? He knows this is public, right? Even worse, it�s starting to seem like half of his account is dedicated to sharing SthrnBelle2358�s photos, and I�m pretty sure that one�s a bot because all her bio says is �hi Gorgeous- i am in your town� and her tweets all link to some site called CamWorldXXX.� Burke has decided to stop following Bradley altogether after discovering a February post in which his cousin asked a porn star to meet in person."
"Saying Dressbarn�s sudden closure had left her bereft of stylish-yet-modest clothing options, local mom Susan Bell reportedly guessed Tuesday that she�ll just have to go shop with all those sluts over at Chico�s now. �I hope I don�t catch the clap rubbing elbows with all those Chico�s tramps while I�m trying to buy a flowy maxi dress or thigh-length cardigan,� said Bell, looking aghast as she scanned the Chico�s website for flattering blouses that wouldn�t �leave my tits popping out all over the place.� �Tank tops, leopard-print ponchos, high-waisted palazzo pants; what am I, some red-mouthed whore? That floozy Kathleen Meyer and her wino friends all shop at Chico�s, and they�re always whoring up the Rotary Club meetings. I can�t let anyone see me shopping there or they�ll think I�m one of those tarts.� At press time, Bell had returned from Talbots empty handed, announcing she wasn�t about to spend $200 to dress like grandma."
"In what witnesses are calling �nothing short of a miracle,� mother Anne Packer�s protective maternal survival instincts evidently prompted an explosive adrenaline release Friday when the mother lifted a heavy child from her car. �Once that woman realized how deep her kid was stuck in there, something changed. Her voice got louder and deeper, she dropped her tote bag where she stood, planted her feet, and by God if she didn�t pick that massive chunker right up off its carseat,� said onlooker Bryan Jackson, who admitted he was �terrified� the 37-year-old woman would be crushed by the sheer mass of her ponderous toddler, but found himself simply too awestruck to help. �I thought her shirt was going to split across her shoulders. You wouldn�t think a normal woman would be able to get her arms around that much corn-syrup-fed toddler, let alone hoist him up into the air. Her legs buckled for a second, but sure enough, she heaved the entire damn thing onto her shoulder. I really thought they were going to need a crane.� Bystanders then watched in awe as Packer carried her colossal child 20 yards to the grocery store."
"Citing political turmoil across the globe and the grim realities of life on a planet facing a climate crisis, jaded local woman Kristen Sloane told reporters Monday that she knows better than to try to bring a tomato plant into a world like this one. �You take a look around yourself, see the way things are these days, and you�d either have to be incredibly selfish or just plain na�ve to subject an innocent cherry tomato seedling to all this,� said Sloane, who mentioned the spread of terrorist attacks and right-wing nationalism as just two of many factors that have discouraged her from starting a home garden. �It�s not that I wouldn�t want some little vines of my own. It�s just that when you consider the world could be facing a mass extinction, not to mention inevitable wars over dwindling resources, you start to ask, �What�s the point? What am I even raising heirloom varieties for?� And if I�m being honest with myself, I can�t justify growing a single tomato, let alone enough to put on salads and make sauce from.� At press time, sources confirmed Sloane was steeling herself to euthanize a wild strawberry plant that had blossomed along her backyard fence.�"
"Quickening her pace as the vehicle flashed its brights, Alabama woman Alison Kyles, 29, reportedly hurried towards home Thursday after spotting a pickup truck full of Alabama lawmakers slowly following her. �At first, I thought I was just being paranoid when I saw that old Chevy full of state legislators creeping along behind me a few blocks back, but then they turned down the same alleyway as me and I started to panic,� said Kyles, who glanced over her shoulder in visible distress as she heard Senator Clyde Chambliss repeatedly revving the truck�s engine. �They�re clearly riled up after a day of legislating and are just out to cause some trouble. Oh, God, I think that�s Del Marsh leaning out of the passenger window and trying to holler something at me. Christ, I�m just going to keep my head down and hope all of them pass me by.� At press time, Kyles had broken into a full-on sprint after realizing in horror that she had accidentally turned onto the street directly in front of the Alabama State House."
"Conveying her concerns that the additional obstacles presented by parenthood would be too much to bear, 12-year-old abuse survivor Abigail Dunn was reportedly worried Wednesday that she wouldn�t be able to handle being a mom on top of everything else she had going on. �I have several book reports and a big algebra test coming up in the next few weeks, and I had even been thinking about trying out for my school�s chorus, but giving birth and caring for an infant is going to really cut into my studying time,� said the seventh-grader, who acknowledged that the intense feelings of shame and fear associated with trauma had already placed her significantly behind her peers and added that there would likely be even greater challenges to raising the offspring of the man who attacked her. �This year has been hard in a lot of ways. We had to move to a new neighborhood, and my family life has been very, very bad, especially recently. My relationship with my stepdad is pretty much a nightmare. I wish I were responsible enough to look after a baby, but I�m just so scared that I won�t be. I�m really sorry.� At press time, Dunn had expressed hope that her unborn child would be friends with the babies of all her fellow pregnant classmates.�"
"Claiming he has �taken a good, long look� at houses, hospitals, churches, and other structures intended for human use or habitation, retail associate Arnold Drucker, 32, said Tuesday that since he has been in or near a great number of buildings, he assumes he would be a pretty good architect. �I mean, I�ve been in tons of buildings and I really paid attention, so I�d be starting with a pretty good leg up, especially considering the number of doors and stairs and whole rooms I�ve used. I�ve almost been in more rooms than I can count,� said Drucker, who concluded that his long history of entering, occupying, and exiting buildings has provided him with sufficient knowledge to begin designing floors, walls, or ceilings. �Now, a movie theater is different because it has lots of seats, and a library�s got to have a bunch of shelves. Museums and sports arenas are trickier, but I could probably just specialize in what I know, which is regular houses and stores. Off the bat, though, every building needs to have a bathroom, ceilings that are taller than a person, and at least one place to put pieces of furniture for sitting. Man, imagine if I sat down and really worked on this.� Drucker has since pledged to further apply himself to his studies upon realizing he has never been inside of a factory, a greenhouse, or a school."
"Taking a moment to reflect on his hard-won personal accomplishment, area liberal Tom Hudson expressed relief Monday that he would never again have to engage in self-examination after finally assembling all the correct opinions. �It definitely wasn�t easy, but now that I have all the proper perspectives on the world all perfectly arranged inside of my head, I know I�ll never need to question my own thoughts, beliefs, or opinions ever again,� said Hudson, proudly recounting his previous efforts at researching all necessary sociopolitical issues, conducting a rigorous self-exploration to determine which of his behaviors were problematic or harmful, and finally achieving the proper balance of beliefs to ensure once and for all that he is an indisputably good person. �It�s such a huge weight off my shoulders. I never have to consider my place in society or my impact on the issues ever again now that I know exactly how to present myself as one of the good guys. This feels amazing.� Hudson was then immediately and savagely attacked by his fellow liberals, who insist that his current views are nowhere near progressive enough."
"Warning the children that the 75-year-old matriarch had been dealing with a number of health problems lately, local mother Wendy Gritton devoted the majority of an hour-long car ride Friday to explaining what things will be different about their grandmother during this visit. �Remember, kids, Nana is slowing down these days and she can�t walk anymore, so don�t expect her to chase you around,� said Gritton, adding that her mother, Cecelia, may not recognize them. �When you hug Grandma, you might notice that she�s lost some weight recently, but don�t worry�she�s still your Grandma. She can�t really hear that well these days, and she�s very tired. We�re going to have to be quiet and on our best behavior.� At press time, Gritton and her kids had finally arrived at their grandmother�s funeral."
"Speculating that the self-anesthetizing, scalpel-bearing woman must have left the house in a big hurry that morning, passengers on a crowded Chicago Brown Line train confirmed Friday that a fellow rider attempted a quick session of plastic surgery on her face while on her way to work. �She must have overslept this morning because she�s really rushing her way through this chin-and-cheek tuck,� observed fellow commuter Josie Xavier, who looked on as the woman boarded the train, sat down, and assembled various supplies on a surgical steel lap tray, including a roll of gauze, a tube of topical numbing cream, and several syringes of Botox and dermal filler to augment her lips and cheeks. �I have to say, she seems like a pro at this. She didn�t even use a mirror half the time, and she marked up her own face with a Sharpie while waiting on the platform. I have to admit, I got kind of nervous for her when we hit that bumpy section of the track while she was shaving her nasal cartilage and the scalpel was millimeters from her eye socket, but she still pulled it off.� Passengers observed, however, that after the woman had reattached her facial epidermal layer and tied off her stitches, she clumsily applied an uneven layer of foundation and used a too-bright lipstick before getting off the train deep in the financial district."
"Telling them the relationship would stay the same no matter what happens, divorcing parents Lydia Block and Greg Pascale took a moment to assure their anxious young children that their family dog would always love them, sources reported Thursday. �I know this is a big change, but even though Mommy and Daddy will live in different houses, Muffett still loves you very, very much,� said Block, gingerly explaining to Tina, 8, and Ben, 6, that despite the many adjustments the divorce would require, their relationship with their beloved 4-year-old Boston terrier would remain just as close as ever. �You may not be able to see him as often as before, but that will make your time with Muffett all the more special when you get to visit him on the weekends. I know it�s going to be hard at first, but you�re very important to Muffett, okay? He loves you just as much as ever, and I want you to remember that.� Block also reassured the children that, no matter what they may hear at school, Muffett doesn�t blame them for the divorce."
"Calling his employees a lean, versatile team capable of being fired at a moment�s notice, local CEO David Bradford described his marketing firm Stact Media as an agile, dynamic company able to respond to any challenge by laying off half of its staff. �This industry is always evolving, but what makes us resilient is our ability to adjust to change, which is invariably done by eliminating 50% of our workforce to cut costs regardless of the problem,� said Bradford, adding that the keys to a successful business in today�s market was creating a corporate culture of cutting good, qualified people with a variety of skills while constantly finding innovative ways to throw a wrench into everyone�s workflow. �When we encounter an obstacle, we don�t go down without a fight against our most experienced, senior workers. We look everyone in the eye and say, �The 20 of you who still work here will push on.� Whether axing production costs during a pivot to video or slashing editorial when page views are down, we react to problems quickly and without the input of those of us with a better, more nuanced understanding of how things work.� Bradford added that another advantage demonstrated by his company is its ability to increase executive salaries during times of crisis."
"Saying that he refused to become just another statistic, local man Frank Campbell disclosed Thursday that he keeps a baseball bat within easy reach of his bed in case any Major League pitchers tried to break in. �It�s all about peace of mind�I�d rather have it and never use it than not have it and get caught looking on a backdoor slider,� said Campbell, who purchased the traditional 34-inch ash Louisville Slugger last May after reading about a horrific 2007 home invasion in nearby Bucktown, during which Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez, then with the Mets, allegedly came out of the bullpen, crept through an open window, and mowed down a family of three in a masterful 13-pitch performance. �Let�s not forget that Chicago has two baseball teams, putting me at twice the risk of someone in Kansas City of facing a 12 to 6 curve at three in the morning, and in the middle of the night, the DH isn�t coming to save you even if you believe in that sort of thing. If a pitcher shows up in my house, I don�t care if he�s a leftie, middle reliever, or some journeyman leaning on the off-speed stuff, I�m ready to protect my zone. If I go down, you can sure as hell bet I�m going down swinging. Listen, I don�t want to use it, but if, say, R.A. Dickey thinks he�s going to come into my house and fool me with the knuckler, I won�t think twice about sitting back and ripping it to the opposite field or even legging out a bunt single. I got that grit.� Campbell, who emphasized he was not normally an offensive threat, hypothesized he could go two for four if everything was really on the line."
"In what is being heralded as a scientific breakthrough on par with Copernicus� heliocentrism or Einstein�s theory of relativity, sources confirmed Thursday that local 13-year-old Shane O�Donnell invented masturbation. O�Donnell�s study of the effects of pillow-humping on the brain�s pleasure center reportedly led the pre-teen to experiment with placing a hand on his genitals and tugging, which was followed by a groundbreaking trial-and-error period involving a variety of tempos and grips. O�Donnell, who called the innovation a eureka moment, then isolated a stroke and grasp that �felt real nice.� Sources reported that the visionary then implemented a never-before-attempted jerking of the penis shaft that yielded what the sixth-grader hypothesized was an erection, later confirmed when increased yank speed produced �some stuff� that O�Donnell referred to as �splooge.� The massive leap forward in sexual stimulation builds off the unprecedented research of 12-year-old classmate Jason Whitman who confirmed at the bike racks that he recently experimented with placing his penis into the stream of a hot tub jet. At press time, several reports indicated close friends have not seen O�Donnell since he invented masturbation and that his mom keeps saying he�s in the shower."
"Mortified at his lack of familiarity with the seemingly mundane utensil, local diner Thad Jenkins succumbed to paralyzing self-consciousness Wednesday upon realizing that he was the only patron of Japanese restaurant Azuki Sushi who was unclear on the proper use of his water glass. �I kept sneaking little peeks at everyone else here and they all seem like naturals at drinking water from their glasses, but I feel completely out of place,� said a visibly exasperated Jenkins, whose attempts to enclose the water glass with his contorted fingers were frustrated as the condensation-slicked container repeatedly slipped from his hand and clattered onto the table, the floor, and once, messily, into his lap. �I tried to discreetly Google a couple tips for water glass neophytes, but nothing worked. Granted, I don�t have much experience dining at traditional Japanese establishments, but I still feel like an ignorant jackass at not being able to pick up this simple skill. Christ, I can sense all the other customers trying not to look at me.� At press time, Jenkins abandoned his attempt to fit in and was just using his fingers to scoop water into his mouth.�"
"Confessing that the rich sound of the stabbing victim�s Yorkshire-bred voice made her �go positively weak,� Genevieve Clare, 31, confirmed Wednesday that she could listen to the dying British man in the street scream for help all day long. �I couldn�t begin to tell you what it is about that accent, but my heart just skips a beat every time I hear him say the words �ambulance� or �someone� or �anyone.� It�s just ridiculously sexy,� said Clare, admitting that the Sheffield native�s lacerated, blood-caked face didn�t really do it for her, but the charming lilt in his voice when he pleaded for a doctor was utterly captivating, even though he repeated the request over a dozen times. �At first, with all his hyperventilating, I thought he might be Irish. He had all these cute sayings, too�how adorable is it to call it �a bit of raspberry jam� when you�re bleeding everywhere? So understated and civilized. I can�t even imitate it��Dear God, I can�t feel m�legs. It�s gone all dark.� No, much hotter when he does it. Oh, wow, I�m blushing, aren�t I?� At press time, Clare was straining to hear the rich, plummy vowels of the man�s moans as they grew ever softer."
"Emphasizing the company�s commitment to providing a sustainable work�life balance, Optech CEO Mark Billings told reporters Tuesday that he encourages employees to take short mental breakdowns for every hour of work. �Every 60 minutes, we want our staff to feel free to take a walk around the block for a quick hyperventilating session when they need to,� said Billings, noting that the company has provided several private and comfortable spaces where employees can go throughout the day to curl their bodies into a tight little ball under the conference table and cry their eyes out. �Work really suffers when people aren�t regularly allowed to walk away from their desks and take a few moments to have a total panic attack. Staff shouldn�t be confined to using brief bathroom visits or lunchtime to freak the fuck out.� Billings added that as long as employees don�t take more than 10 to 15 minutes for their short bursts of existential crises, it actually increases the company�s productivity."
"Saying that he clearly learned all the wrong lessons from the classic animated programs, several people witnessing their coworker Aaron Rowe wearing a Cobra Command T-shirt Tuesday confirmed that he missed the whole point of G.I. Joe. �Dude, that�s not what the show�s about at all. It�s like he didn�t pay attention to a single episode,� said sales associate Paolo Yates, expressing feelings of disappointment at his officemate for supporting a group whose sole objective was to �sow mayhem and destruction.� �This is just a slap in the face to our greatest Real American Heroes. Cobra was clearly a team of bad guys, even if they sometimes pretended to be peaceful in order to dupe the Joes. For Aaron to proudly display that hateful iconography on his shirt and present it as some sort of moral symbol is just flat-out wrong, and I�m a little freaked out that he even knew where to buy something like that.� At press time, Rowe had been admonished by his employer, who claimed �such divisive and transgressive iconography does not represent the values of Davis and Lee�s Proud Rebel Confederated Plumbing Supply, Inc.�"
"Confusing several immediate members of the family of Sophia Lindbergh with her flamboyant sorrow, grieving relatives confirmed Tuesday that a random uncle�s wife was �sure crying a bunch� throughout their grandma�s funeral. �Wow, that lady�s really losing it there. Grandpa isn�t even crying that much,� said granddaughter Casey Lindberg-Simmons, who was unable to confirm that her grandmother had ever met Uncle Mike�s third wife, but seemed to remember that �Nana� was too ill to attend their wedding. �She spent an awfully long time at the casket saying goodbye, but I doubt they had much of a relationship. I barely ever see Uncle Mike, either. They live in Boulder or Denver or something, so I�m a little surprised to see them make the trip. And not to put too fine a point on it, but grandma was 93, so she had a good run. There�s no reason to be wailing like it�s some sudden damn tragedy.� Uncle Mike was later observed gently but firmly restraining his wife from walking to the lectern to deliver her thoughts during the eulogy."
"As he cast about in vain for potential topics of conversation, local bridegroom Adam Hartwell reportedly panicked Monday, having completely run out of things to talk about five minutes into his marriage. �After the ceremony, I talked about some of our mutual friends and mentioned a couple details from my childhood, but at this point I�m drawing a total blank,� said Hartwell, who during the wedding dinner took multiple trips to the bathroom in an effort to break up the awkward silences he shared with his new wife, Lisa. �I already covered my feelings for her in the vows, so there wasn�t much to add there. Then I complimented her on her dress and talked about how perfect the weather has been, but all together that took up less than a minute. At least once the dinner�s over I can have a few drinks and hang out with my buddies at the reception.� At press time, sources confirmed the newlyweds had returned to the bridal suite at their hotel, where they were said to be watching television in two separate rooms."
"Observing that southbound motorists should begin to come across signs just after passing the rest area, sources reported Wednesday that there is an adult superstore off exit 16. �Yeah, so what you do is, you just hang a left at the end of that off-ramp and it�s pretty much across from the McDonald�s and down a ways from the Holiday Inn,� said one local source speaking on condition of anonymity. �If you hit the Party City or the fireworks place, you�ve gone too far. There�s one called X-Site off of mile marker 177, too, but the Adult Central Superstore is the one you want. Two floors. They got toys, DVDs, mags, everything. There used to be a decent one called Lion�s Den if you get off U.S. 76 and take the frontage road way down past Hardee�s, but lately, it�s kind of for shit. I�d just go to Adult Central. Closer anyway.� The source further urged interested parties to find out when Bud�s working, as he can hook you up with a 30-minute viewing booth session if you buy more than $50 of DVDs."
"Noting that the unexpected purchase was completely without precedent or preamble, family sources confirmed Tuesday that mother Ellen Fogarty, 54, had evidently just spent $83.50 on an owl necklace from a stall at the Waukesha art fair. �Supposedly, it�s handcrafted, but still, Mom barely ever even wears jewelry. And since when is she so into owls?� said daughter Grace Fogarty, 19, expressing shock at her typically frugal mother�s gravitation toward and sudden purchase of a silver-plated owl pendant on a thin leather cord during their hometown�s annual Craft Bash art fair. �Maybe I would understand if the necklace were made by Somali war widows or something, but I�m pretty sure it�s just a normal lady with a basement workshop in Milwaukee. And to pay almost a hundred bucks for it? She could definitely get something similar at Chico�s for, like, $20. This is so weird. I mean, when is she even going to wear that?� Fogarty�s disbelief only intensified when her mother moved on to the next stall and scoffed at a display of $4 artisanal soaps, calling them �a total rip-off.�"
"Asking whether possession of an exceptional sexual organ he was forbidden to use was perhaps a test from the Lord, local Roman Catholic priest Russell Calhoun reportedly lamented Tuesday the fact that God cursed him with an incredible penis. �Why, oh, why would the Lord demand chastity of a man upon whom He has bestowed this magnificent, perfectly sculpted cock?� Calhoun said as he questioned why God, in His infinite wisdom, had called such an exquisitely hung man to the priesthood, thereby requiring him to cloister away 10 inches of spectacular phallus that could otherwise be used to bring untold sexual pleasure to others. �It seems selfish to hide away a gift like this magnificent dong and not share it with the world, but I must trust that it is all part of God�s plan. Much like Jonah and his power of prophecy, my blessing is also my burden, for I would surely be deep-dickin� untold numbers of men and women right now were it not for the strictures of my vocation.� At press time, sources confirmed Father Calhoun was taking solace in the fact that, if nothing else, at least several of his church�s altar boys were blessed with the opportunity to gaze upon his sublime penis once a week."
"Cautious of ruining his session by stumbling upon sexual activity ranging from possibly disturbing to actually illegal, local man Stephen Baretta decided Tuesday that a pornographic video featuring an unfamiliar acronym in its title was ultimately too much of a risk to click on. �I�ve never seen XTPF before, and believe me, I�m on here quite a bit, so I it�s best to just steer clear,� said Baretta, who admitted to venturing a few guesses based on the video�s thumbnail and elected not to test his theories �since it�s not like you can unsee things afterwards.� �I�ve seen some pretty weird shit, but still, I wouldn�t want to go down any really dark rabbit holes, especially since I stumbled into finding out about CBT last month. Seriously, when I think of just the possible fucked-up Japanese shit alone, I�m way better off not knowing.� After finding himself too jaded to achieve satisfaction from his usual videos, Baretta was reportedly facing a minimum of three years in federal prison and possible extradition to Finland."
"Moments after wrestling the Switch controller from Dylan Wheeler�s hands and pushing the child towards the door of the intensive care unit, Wheeler�s parents mollified the 9-year-old Monday by promising him that he could go right back to playing video games once he had given his dying grandfather one last hug. �Just give Grampa a little hug, and maybe even a kiss, and you can go straight back to Splatoon. Can you do that for me, Dylan?� said Cyndi Wheeler, 39, stressing to her son that the simple gesture would mean �a whole bunch� to her ailing father, who, despite being rendered nearly insensate by painkillers, had repeatedly and tearfully communicated his desire to see his only grandson one last time. �It�ll only take a second, honey. All I need you to do�Dylan, I need you to listen to me now�all I need you to do is say �bye-bye� and do a both-arms hug while counting to three like we practiced.� Sources close to the Wheelers claim the third-grader spent his grandfather�s last moment on Earth wondering what McDonald�s treat he would be rewarded with on the drive home."
"As she fielded seemingly innocuous questions about her work schedule and childhood history with pets, local woman Daphne Horschel appeared oblivious to the fact that her neighbor, Brooks Tiller, was carefully grooming her for cat-sitting, apartment sources confirmed Monday. �You work from home, right? It must be nice having that flexibility,� Tiller said to Horschel, who reportedly had no idea their polite banter and a recent invitation to a dinner party were all steps in a clandestine vetting procedure being carried out to determine if she would be a willing and reliable cat-sitter. �Uh-oh, look who came out to say hello. Snuggles is usually pretty shy, so he must really like you!� At press time, reports indicated Horschel had thanked Tiller for a plate of baked goods that were part of an elaborate stratagem designed to build just enough goodwill so that she would feel obligated to take care of his cat next weekend."
"Deeply saddened that one of their own was confined to such punishing solitude, employees of DigiMax Solutions expressed concern Friday that the benefits of the company�s open-office floor plan had not been extended to the media firm�s CEO, Carter Foss. �I feel so bad that he doesn�t get to enjoy the intense collaborative synergy of this work environment the way the rest of us do,� said junior developer Megan Chen, one of three dozen DigiMax employees who spends the entirety of her workday sitting within arm�s reach of her colleagues at a long, unpartitioned table, and is unable to look up from her laptop without risking a moment of awkward eye contact. �It�s hard to imagine what it must be like for him to go through his day without hearing every intimate detail of his coworkers� lives, or allowing them to hear his. How does he even get any work done? And just think, whenever he wants to have a one-on-one conversation with someone at his desk, there�s no one around to listen except him and the person he�s talking to. That must be so terribly isolating.� A downcast Chen was later seen shaking her head as Foss closed the door of his office in order to make a routine private phone call."
"Alighting on the concrete to study the colorful but lifeless body, a sparrow reflected on the fragile and fleeting nature of life Thursday after coming across a dead human on the sidewalk. �Looking at it, so still and delicate, lying there on the ground, it just reminds you that each and every one of us has but a short time to spend on this Earth,� said the migratory grassland insectivore, admitting he didn�t usually take time to think about the nature of mortality, but that seeing a lifeless human sprawled on a sidewalk, on a lawn, or even rebounding limply from the windshield of a passing car, was enough to make anyone stop and think. �The poor thing. Sad that it probably died all alone. Life really is all the more precious for being temporary, you know? I�m just glad my species abandons its fledglings after roughly 20 days�I�d hate to have to talk to my kids about this.� At press time, the common raven to whom the sparrow had been speaking noted that the dead human�s eyes were delicious."
"Remarking on their relative�s unusually eventful romantic life, nephews and nieces of Janine Harrison, 48, confirmed Monday that their aunt managed to somehow both marry and divorce two separate times since the last time they had seen her. �I don�t think it�s been that long�five years at the outside�but it seems Aunt Janine has been through a lot,� said Peter Miles, youngest son of Janine�s brother Harold, struggling to work through the most probable mental timeline of his aunt�s recent relationships. �So, the last time I saw her she was still engaged to that surf-shop owner, Tony something-or-other, but they had been fighting a lot, so I�m not really too surprised they eventually divorced. Apparently, she also has some ex-husband named Lazlo now; their relationship went south after his skydiving academy went belly-up and she got custody of their German shepherd. I thought there was also a random goateed guy somewhere in there, marine salvage broker, name escapes me, not that it�s really important since it seems he was some sort of side piece. You have to admit it�s impressive she�s able to move on so quickly.� Miles later received a call from his cousin informing him that their aunt was three weeks into planning a Costa Rican destination wedding with Glen, a previously unheard-of classical guitarist and restaurateur."
"Insisting that it was just their nana�s �special way� of saying goodbye, mourners confirmed Friday that the Shreve family had respected their grandmother�s wishes to have an opened-bloused funeral. �I know it makes some people a little uncomfortable to see her lying there, shirt open and tits out, but this is how she wanted to be remembered,� said 59-year-old family matriarch Cecelia Shreve through tears, who went on to credit the mortician�s tasteful presentation, and for �making those knockers look 20 years younger.� �You know, it�s not for everyone, but I think seeing her rack out in the open really helped bring the room some closure. Unfortunately, it still doesn�t change the fact that tomorrow, I have to wake up in a world where my mom and her beautiful bazongas aren�t around anymore. God bless �the girls.�� At press time, the Shreve family rushed to console Cecelia, who had started to sob uncontrollably after kissing her mother on the chest one last time."
"Hoping to communicate the numerous health risks that can stem from obesity, local doctor Peter Gerheart took time during an annual checkup to gently inform patient Brianna Torres that he is overweight, sources reported Friday. �This is never an easy thing to tell a patient, but I think it�s important to be transparent about this�I am overweight,� said the primary care physician, who explained that his family history of obesity may have contributed to his current weight and went on to reference a series of charts outlining how his body mass index and high blood pressure put him at greater risk for heart disease. �I don�t want to stigmatize or shame myself here, but I do want you to know how important it is for me to make some changes to my lifestyle. Even moderate exercise and a slightly more varied diet could have a major impact on my health, and if I don�t make these changes now, I could face some serious issues down the road. So when I see you for your next checkup, I�d like to see myself a little slimmer.� According to reports, Gerheart went on to show Torres a list of healthy snack options he could eat in order to break his junk food habit.�"
"Citing concerns over historically high seasonal traffic and the resulting potential flight delays, a Canada goose was thinking of migrating home two to three weeks early in order to avoid the crowds, avian sources confirmed Friday. �My friends think I�m a bit neurotic, but I just want a quiet, stress-free flight home,� said the 8-year-old waterfowl, lamenting his experiences sharing a pond with, �like, 500 tired and stressed-out geese� during his return trip to Wisconsin last mating season. �If I get a decent head start, I won�t have to deal with the big flocks and all the endless damn honking. Last year, the stopover sites were so crowded that no one could find a decent place to shit before the flight took back off�everyone had to take a dump in the air, and when you�re the last guy in the big V, well, that�s just no way to live.� Complicating the goose�s travel plans was the realization that he would be �monumentally bored� after arriving in Wisconsin early and spending idle days with his parents.�"
"Stumbling through the restaurant and gaming establishment in a dazed and incoherent stupor, local man Rob Woodham, 31, reportedly slipped into a ghastly, blinding fog of insanity Thursday just before he was asked if this was his first time at a Dave & Buster�s location. �Can I get you a menu?� said a waiter, slowly transforming into a top-hat-wearing anthropomorphic polar bear in the maddened mind of Woodham, who�with his consciousness shattered by the swirling maelstrom of flashing lights and clanging bells amidst a chaotic realm where all logic had ceased to exist�could only drool and answer in crude grunts. �Sir? Excuse me, sir? Would you like to try our chicken wing special, or maybe I could just start you off with [the divine serpent, which you will cradle in your arms until true bliss flows freely through your veins, releasing you from the cruel facade of your mortal prison]?� At press time, sources reported that a profusely sweating Woodham had urinated everywhere and screamed out in hideous, esoteric tongues before tearing off his shirt and running outside."
"Competing to secure the new pet�s allegiance, members of the Thomas family were reportedly locked in a heated bidding war Thursday as each tried to convince their cat, Cookie, to sleep in their bed. �So far, I�ve provided the most perks�sneaking him extra scoops of food, offering him handfuls of catnip, and giving him nice pats all day,� said Avery Thomas, 11, who explained that she had begun granting the cat additional incentives, like jingly toys and tuna treats, after noticing her younger brother was leaving his electric blanket on for the 16-month-old American shorthair despite it being warm inside. �Unfortunately, my sister may have made a hard-to-beat offer by waking up an hour early every morning just to feed him. It won�t be easy to top that, though I�m not afraid to bring out the big guns and aim the laser pointer at my bed if that�s what it comes to.� At press time, sources confirmed the cat had decided to sleep in a laundry hamper full of dirty towels."
"Regaling a group of prospective soldiers with tales from his youth, military recruiter Luke Coleman fondly recalled Wednesday when he was just a na�ve kid being coaxed into making a binding eight-year commitment to the Army in order to fulfill a recruitment quota. �Man, I remember back when I was your age, just hanging out at the mall when a recruiter came up to offer me the chance to be one of the kids he needed to sign up in order to meet his quarterly target,� said the 35-year-old staff sergeant, who appeared to grow nostalgic while discussing the day he was slowly worn down and browbeaten into enlisting by a recruiter who asked if he was a real man. �It�s crazy because I look back and I don�t even recognize that kid. I was just some scrawny teenager in a hand-me-down Starter jacket until Sgt. Hadley pulled me aside and said I could get super jacked during basic training�and that if I enlisted right away, I could get a $20,000 signing bonus. Honestly, I wish I could be back in your shoes with several tours of duty still ahead of me.� At press time, Coleman, who collected enlistment paperwork from his 12th recruit of the month, then reminisced about the days when he didn�t wake up screaming in the middle of the night."
"Claiming he found the turn to be well banked and cambered with perfect sightlines, motorist Calvin Henry declared Wednesday that a bend along Florida State Road 44 was definitely not sharp enough to warrant the dozen or so roadside memorials along its outside shoulder. �I mean, this is a pretty soft turn,� said Henry, noting that the section of road in question was barely even noticeable as far as highway curves were concerned, let alone a deathtrap deserving so many combined remembrances and warnings. �Would you look at all these plastic flowers and white crosses? Either the people around here don�t know how to drive or they�re just goofing around. It�s not like there�s even a steep drop on the other side of the shoulder. Seriously, people, calm down�I could take this curve at 80 without breaking a sweat.� Henry was unavailable for further comment, having become so distracted by the abundance of memorials that suffered a violent single-car accident."
"Kicking himself for focusing all his energy on the wrong thing, local liberal Brian Whitmore reportedly felt like an idiot Tuesday for placing the entirety of his hopes on Special Counsel Robert Mueller�s probe into President Trump instead of the New York state prosecutors� investigation. �I can�t believe I was so naive as to think that the Mueller report would be the silver bullet implicating Trump in criminal election interference when it�s obviously going to be the Southern District inquiry,� said lifelong Democrat Whitmore, 31, adding that while he was still disappointed Mueller�s report hadn�t found the president guilty of collusion with Russia, several news articles he had just read made it clear to him that the U.S. Attorney�s Office for the Southern District of New York held all the real investigative power. �How could I have missed it before? It was always going to be impossible for Mueller to prove Trump colluded, but the campaign finance allegations�that�s where the real action is. In fact, this was probably just what Mueller wanted all along. He did what he could do with his limited investigative mandate and now he�s handing off the probe to state prosecutors who will have a much wider purview to throw the book at Trump. I mean, they�re already working with Michael Cohen, and I bet that�s only the beginning. I just feel so dumb for spending all that time obsessing over the Mueller investigation when I should�ve been spending all my time obsessing over the New York one.� At press time, Whitmore was looking into getting his tattoo of Robert Mueller removed so he could replace it with one of New York federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss."
"Taken aback by the lack of questions and discussion, Dr. Angela Rosen of St. Joseph�s Hospital confirmed Tuesday that she was distressed by how quickly the family of 96-year-old Norman Green arrived at the decision to terminate end-of-life care for the ailing World War II veteran. �Before I even had time to finish listing all of Mr. Green�s treatment options, the family was expressing unanimous agreement that his life support should pretty much be yanked immediately,� said a visibly concerned Dr. Rosen, noting that despite there being no realistic chance of life without mechanical assistance for their grandfather�a man who earned three Purple Hearts while serving under General Patton and was married to his wife for 67 years�nobody in the family had bothered to ask. �You�d think that since we�re talking about a man who lived for nearly a century, someone in his rather extensive family would have had a tougher time making the choice to pull the plug. They didn�t huddle or really even so much as look at each other before making that call. Two minutes after that, they were chatting away with each other as if nothing major had happened.� No specific time has yet been slated for Norman Green�s disconnection from life support equipment as members of the family were still conflicted regarding which one of them would actually get to pull the plug."
"Admitting he now felt �a bit foolish,� 34-year-old local artist Austin Vermillion was reportedly beginning to realize Monday just how wrong he�s been after spending the last two years drawing pictures of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin making out. �In light of the release of the Attorney General�s summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller�s long-awaited report, I can now determine the joke of Trump and Putin kissing that I�ve been rehashing over the past two years is completely and utterly inaccurate,� said Vermillion, who apologized for jumping the gun and recklessly depicting the two world leaders locked in a sensual embrace in hundreds of sketches, prints, enamel pins, and screen-printed T-shirts currently for sale in his popular Etsy store. �At the time, I didn�t think there was any other way to show that they were engaging in some sort of illicit relationship other than depicting homosexuality. I�m very sorry that I didn�t wait until all the facts came in. Now I realize I should have never drawn that cartoon of Trump all dressed up in leather BDSM gear sharing a foursome with Putin, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr.� At press time, Vermillion attempted to make up for his ill-advised and fallacious artwork by producing a new sketch of Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) jerking off Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY.)"
"Delaying his usual afternoon session until such time as he felt genuine creative purpose, local man Andy Conrad decided to wait for a spark of inspiration before getting started on his masturbating. �I�ve been putting it off for most of the day because I really need to be in the right state of mind,� said Conrad, whose efforts to maintain a consistent schedule of self-pleasuring for 20 minutes each day had established a fragile momentum, but at the cost of novelty and quality. �I was on a hot streak for a while, but you can�t force true inspiration, especially in the morning. Masturbating every day can be a real grind, and I�m trying to avoid just going through the motions. I know some people can just force themselves to pound one out, but I need to have a strong, clear vision and sense of direction. I heard Ernest Hemingway could just set his jaw and go at any hour of the day or night, but I just can�t operate like that.� At press time, Conrad had decided to take a walk in the park to clear his mind and possibly get some material."
"Taken aback by their mother�s high-maintenance wardrobe, household sources confirmed Thursday that none of Bianca Dern�s clothes can be simply placed in a standard washing machine for cleaning. �Mom won�t even let me touch any of her laundry. I�ve tried to help out, but everything needs to be washed according to some super specific method,� said daughter Vanessa Dern of her mother�s various work slacks, sweaters, and silk-blend blouses, all of which involve unique, labor-intensive, and almost unheard-of methods of individual laundering. �Her jeans have to be hand-washed and then hung up to dry outside. There�s a tweed jacket she scrubs with a special brush. She has a weird sundress that she just rinses with a water-and-baking-soda solution�I have no idea what kind of fabric that is. She only owns two things that can even be sent to the dry cleaners, and she pins special instructions to those.� The younger Dern admitted to simply spraying her mother�s dirty laundry with Febreeze and calling it a day."
"Confessing that he was completely blindsided by the request, parent Erik Schaff said Wednesday that his son Cody, 8, needed a full-body costume and 30 individually wrapped treats by tomorrow morning for some sort of school celebration. �Cody just handed me a note saying that the third grade is holding an event for some bullshit called �Friendship Day� tomorrow, and he needs to dress up as a character from his favorite book and bring in a treat for some in-classroom picnic deal,� said Schaff, emphasizing that the celebration also evidently requires his son to memorize four lines of a poem his class would be performing in a pageant less than 24 hours from the time of the notification. �There�s a whole list of snack types to avoid due to allergies, and naturally, the brownies and marshmallow squares have already been reserved by other parents. The teachers are also strongly suggesting that I help Cody build a �Friendship Diorama� to display during the �Friendship Fair� in the afternoon. What the hell is this? And why do I have to sign a permission slip when they�re not leaving campus? Also, what does the $10 suggested donation go towards? Jesus Christ, Cody, seriously.� At press time, Schaff had resigned himself to taking the afternoon off work upon learning that most parents would be attending the assembly."
"Realizing that he spent years fighting for the life of what turns out to be a �little fucking gremlin,� anti-abortion activist Logan Brecken, 24, had a change of heart Tuesday after seeing detailed photographs of a human fetus for the first time. �Oh, my God! I can�t believe I used to stand outside Planned Parenthood and chant �They have fingernails,� because those are not cute little baby fingernails. Those are claws or some shit. I should�ve shouted �Gross! Kill it! Kill it!�� said the former pro-lifer, admitting he had always pictured an innocent human child in the womb, but now believes no good Christian would be opposed to killing something so obviously evil. �This gross little alien tadpole already has a heartbeat? That�s freaking terrifying. Is�is that a tail? Ew, ew, ew�the bumps on its spine, the weird-ass neck...The teeth, Jesus, the teeth. If my life began like that, I want to fucking kill myself. When I first heard about abortion, I thought it was pretty bad. Now, I�m not so sure. No way this thing has the right to live.� Brecken, however, has not softened his hardline stance against a woman�s right to choose, and now flatly states that abortion should simply be mandatory."
"Confusing her friends and colleagues as to what could possibly drive her to undertake such an expedition, sources confirmed Friday that aspiring explorer Jillian Greene�s solo hike through Yosemite National Park has evidently nothing to do with soul-searching, an inner journey, or any other form of self-discovery. �Naturally, I assumed she was attempting to deal with a catastrophic event, the loss of a parent, or a devastating breakup or something similar. But no, Jillian is really just using her vacation time to be out in nature, just walking for the sake of walking, I guess?� said Greene�s coworker Demory Jacobs, who noted the baffling 10-day trip requires Greene to carry all her own gear and food, sleep under the stars in all manner of weather, and be completely cut off from technology while in no way helping her come to terms with her true self, make peace with her demons, or ease her transition into a new chapter of her life. �She�s not graduating from anything, trying to reconnect with her inner child, attempting to understand the soul of her distant but nature-loving father, exploring an external wilderness in order to comprehend and inner universe, assuaging her cultural guilt over lands stolen from indigenous peoples, or trying to kick heroin, so we can�t think and any reason she�d want to explore the outdoors. We�re all pretty freaked out.� At press time, Greene�s friends and family expressed regret over not staging an intervention immediately after she revealed her desire to just enjoy the fresh air, silence, and sunsets."
"Positively brimming with joy after welcoming the infant into their home, first-time grandparents Edward and Colleen Harris told reporters Friday they were overwhelmed with emotion now that they finally understood what it meant to love a child. �I can�t even begin to put my happiness into words because I�ve never felt anything like this before,� said the new grandmother, adding that she could think of nothing in her 71 years that could even begin to compare with the experience of looking into the eyes of her newborn grandson, Logan, and seeing a tiny piece of herself reflected back. �It�s as though I never knew what life was really about until this moment. You spend seven decades focused almost completely on yourself, and then suddenly you�re given this whole new set of priorities. From now on, Logan will be the one who comes first.� At press time, the proud grandparents were reportedly crying, saying they felt as if everything they had done with their lives up to that point had been completely meaningless."
"Complaining that he is never able to relax and just be himself, local dog Crackers reported Thursday that he feels as though he always has to be �on� when he�s around the family to whom he belongs. �It�s like I always have to put on this show, whether it�s chasing a squeaky toy or licking someone�s face, and it just gets exhausting, you know?� said the 3-year-old labrador mix, explaining that he feels expectations are being placed on him every time a member of the family so much as pets him, though he acknowledged the cat who also lives in the home seems able to shrug off such burdens. �I can�t be perking up my ears and running to the door every time the kid comes home, let alone playing fetch every time we go to the park. I�m kind of an introvert, after all. Sometimes I just want to chill in the shade and not have to run up and sniff everyone who passes by. If it keeps going like this, someday I�m going to snap and just run away.� At press time, sources confirmed Crackers had decided that biting a stranger on a walk might be the best way for his owners to get the message."
"Doing his best to cast the negative, intrusive, and ultimately accurate thoughts from his mind, local piece of shit Aaron Keliher, whom everyone fucking despises, reportedly assured himself Thursday that it�s all in his head. �Sometimes, when I�m getting really down on myself, I start to think people must just hate me,� said the fucking loser, who, according to multiple sources, is in fact hated by pretty much everybody because he has no redeeming qualities anyone could ever find worthwhile and, honestly, just kind of sucks. �I need to keep these bad feelings in check. Otherwise, I�ll spiral and wind up in a dark place. Like just last week, I was convinced I had done some silly thing to piss off [an acquaintance who was indeed pissed off by the total shitheel, and with good reason]. But in all likelihood, it had nothing to do with me at all.� The piece of shit went on to voice the incorrect assumption that his mother had not yet returned his last few calls to her because she was probably really busy."
"Saying it was just �common courtesy� to sanitize them for whoever exercised next, local man Nick Dukas told reporters Thursday that he always makes sure to wipe down his personal trainer after working out. �I sweat all over, so it would be pretty rude of me not to at least clean the fitness instructor up before hitting the locker room,� said Dukas as he wiped the surface of the muscular, over-six-foot-tall exercise consultant with a disposable disinfecting cloth, explaining how gross it was to start a workout session when your fitness guru was all smelly and covered in germs. �Not only is it important to prevent the spread of bacteria and infections, but also, disinfecting his hands and feet only takes two seconds. I remember using a guy named Daniel once after somebody forgot to clean him, and I got the nastiest rash.� At press time, Dukas added that after wiping down his personal trainer, he always makes sure to put him back in the correct spot on the rack."
"Calling him the most promising recruit he�s seen in a decade of coaching, tennis instructor Thomas Petrov confirmed Thursday that he sees real potential in his student Aiden McDavid�s family income. �From his expensive Babolat racket to the brand-new Nikes, I can tell this kid�s parents have everything I�m looking for,� said Petrov, noting that he saw promise in Aiden the moment his parents dropped him off at practice in a brand-new Mercedes Benz sedan. �I�ve mentored a lot of kids throughout the years, and I can tell that Aiden�s special�his parents aren�t just some lawyers or mid-level executives, they�re running a hedge fund. Some kids show hints of potential, but these people are rocking Cartier watches and vacationing in Italy. They�re the real deal.� At press time, Petrov convinced Aiden�s parents that he could be something really special after watching the teen pack up his supplies in an $1,200 Burberry duffel bag."
"Declaring that he couldn�t wait to see his wife�s eyes light up once she heard the news, local husband Kevin McCoy, 32, reportedly spent $238.76 Wednesday to buy his wife tickets to see a singer she wants to fuck. �Phoebe is just crazy about [the idea of being throroughly and repeatedly boned by] John Legend,� said McCoy of his spouse of eight years, who routinely imagines the musician�s face and body expertly pleasuring her when she closes her eyes during intercourse with her husband. �She�s always wanted to see [and be brought to repeated shuddering orgasms by] John Legend, so I�m really stoked I could make that dream come true. I managed to snag third-row seats, so she�ll get a great view [of Legend to use as masturbation fodder for years to come].� Sources close to McCoy added that he seemed completely oblivious to how his wife flushed a deep red and could barely stammer a breathless �Thank you� when he revealed he had also purchased her a backstage pass."
"Paralyzed by the infinite possibilities involved in moving from his branch, a Menelaus blue morpho butterfly admitted Tuesday that he was uncomfortably aware of the potential to irrevocably damage our timeline with a single misplaced beat of his wings. �I�d really like to flit over to the fern, but the pressure on me is insane�one extra flap of my wings and, six months from now, some Cambodian village is destroyed in a typhoon,� said the three-week-old Morpho menelaus, whose debilitating fear of accidentally creating a chain of events irrevocably leading to ISIS ruling humanity while volcano ash blots out the sky has nearly destroyed his ability to make decisions. �To make matters worse, that fern is above a little freshwater rivulet, and if I dislodge even the tiniest leaf and it disrupts the flow of water to the sea, we could be looking at a global flu pandemic within a decade. On the other hand, if I don�t flap over there, unchecked airflow and hydrodynamic patterns might result in a rogue wave crashing ashore in Rio de Janeiro next week. I just hate this fucking job.� The butterfly eventually chose to play it safe and alight on a nearby fallen log where it was promptly crushed by a time traveler�s boot."
"Smoothing down the garment before carefully placing it back on the rack, local woman Alicia McNaughton chose to pass up on the dress Monday that would have reportedly altered the course of her life forever. �Maybe this one just isn�t for me,� said McNaughton, abandoning forever the elegantly cut dress, the color and drape and feel of which would have given her the self-assurance to ascend the social hierarchy at work, captivate the eye of a talent agent, and usher her into a brilliant stratum of fame and luxury, which she would navigate with humor and aplomb until a chance meeting aboard the yacht in the Monaco marina when her true soulmate would have swept her off her feet. �It�s pretty enough, but a little pricey. I guess don�t really need a new dress [to transform life as I know it in ways I couldn�t even begin to imagine, becoming so synonymous with my ascendant fame that it becomes known as �The McNaughton Dress,� imitated but never equalled by women worldwide and eventually rendered in marble by the greatest artist of the age as he weeps while sculpting the statue for my Parisian tomb, where inspired women will lay flowers until the end of time].� McNaughton settled on a $15 cheaper chambray blouse that will be instrumental in her meeting an insurance adjuster she will date on and off for 14 lackluster months"
"Regretting that he never got a chance to sample even a single imperial stout during his years abusing alcohol, recovering alcoholic Scott Rimer expressed bitterness Monday that he had the misfortune to reach the lowest point of his life before the craft beer boom. �Goddammit. I can�t believe I hopelessly bottomed out and made the difficult decision to clean up my act just months before small, dedicated breweries started gaining real traction,� said Rimer, who confessed to feeling that his entire time as a drunk was squandered pounding Pabst Blue Ribbon and Bud Light when he could have delayed sobriety a bit longer and enjoyed a wide variety of hoppy India pale ales for a while. �I wasted years of my life drinking Schlitz in shady run-down dives. If I�d only had a little patience, I could have been in a hip brewery with dozens of different styles of beer rotating on tap. The alcohol content is high�I could have been getting fucking hammered so quickly. The bleak, gray hellscape of my addiction would have been a lot more colorful if I had known about sours, lambics, and barleywines.� Rimer was later found in his garage, relapsed and unconscious, his body curled around an empty growler of a fruity and complex Belgian tripel."
"Wishing he could just curl up under his blanket and die, infant Liam Henderson reportedly felt foolish Thursday after realizing a stranger he had responded to on the subway was actually waving at the toddler sitting one seat over. �Oh my God, I was smiling and babbling at him the whole time�I�m such an idiot,� said Henderson, adding that he was mortified at having burbled nonsense syllables at a man who was in fact interacting with a 2-year-old girl sitting nearby. �There�s no way to brush this one under the rug. I mean, I made a loud cooing noise and flailed my arms up and down like a complete moron. I must have looked like a total fucking doofus. I swear, if my arms were just a little longer, I would pull that emergency lever and abandon ship.� Sources confirmed Henderson then spent a few seconds looking frantically around the train car for something else he could pretend to have been laughing at when he suddenly became distracted by his toes."
"Filled with dread at the thought of the upcoming relationship milestone, Erika Moreau, 30, told reporters Thursday she is nervous for dinner this evening, when her boyfriend will finally meet the person she turns into around her parents. �I just don�t know how he�s going to react�she�s a lot to take, you know?� Moreau said of the difficult, obstinate woman she is powerless to avoid becoming when in the same room as one of her parents. �This is a really big step, and I hope she doesn�t scare Trevor off. It�s tough, because my last relationship actually ended not long after my ex met her. She�s just so unpredictable. She�ll fly off the handle over the tiniest things or start giving you the silent treatment for no reason. Ugh. I really hope she doesn�t get too drunk this time.� At press time, sources confirmed Moreau and her boyfriend were stunned into silence after the suddenly irate woman interrupted dinner to scream, �I�m an adult, goddammit�don�t talk to me like I�m stupid!�"
"Struggling to adjust to the controls and interfaces of the unfamiliar vehicle, business traveler Sam Mancini confirmed Wednesday that he had spent the initial 20 minutes in his rented 2018 Mazda 3 attempting to locate the automobile�s steering wheel. �I don�t�okay, hold on. Is this the type you flip up or something? I�m lost when it comes to these newer models,� said Mancini, running his hands along the top of the dashboard for the third time while visually confirming that the steering wheel was not located in the center console, incorporated into the infotainment touchscreen, or concealed in a hidden compartment of the instrument panel. �I�ve heard that the latest cars pretty much drive themselves, but you�d think there would be some sort of steering wheel. I mean, yes, there�s a big round device in front of me, but it�s got all these buttons and switches and I�m not completely comfortable resting my hands on it.� At press time, Mancini had been on the phone with Enterprise customer service for an additional 20 minutes."
"Realizing that the black-and-white family photo on his bedside table seems like a scene from someone else�s life, puzzled divorc� David Reed admitted Tuesday that he didn�t even recognize the smiling, happy people in the picture that came with the frame. �My God, it�s like I don�t even know who these people are,� said the father of three, staring at the blandly beautiful family of four portrayed in the 5-by-7-inch picture frame originally purchased from Bed Bath & Beyond. �Whose life am I living? I mean, look at them. Who even are they? These kids, not a care. And her�she�s so beautiful. She�s so happy. She�s almost a stranger. But you know who the real stranger here is? Me.� A despondent Reed then reportedly threw the frame into the mirror over his dresser and, upon seeing his own unrecognizable face staring back at him from a hundred splintered reflections, dropped to his knees and wept uncontrollably."
"Saying it would be nice for her cat Joplin to have some company during the day, realtor Christie Marie Wolfe, 34, adopted a second cat Tuesday for Joplin to terrorize while she is at work. �I hate to leave the poor guy alone all day, so I figured it�d be nice for him to have a companion cat to stalk across the dining room and corner in the pantry,� said Wolfe, whose busy schedule means she often leaves Joplin at home to shred his toys and the household furniture. �I feel better knowing that, while I�m out at the gym or hanging with friends, Joplin has someone to intimidate and bully. I can�t wait to come home and find him hissing and relentlessly swatting at his new little buddy.� At press time, Wolfe had taken to social media to post videos of �the new fuzzball� cringing motionless beneath her couch."
"Brought to the brink of tears by the concerned looks in the eyes of a few of his loved ones, Alex Sheehorn, 29, was presented with a serious wake-up call Wednesday in the form of the piss-poor attendance at his intervention. �I walked into my place to find Mom, Dad, and my Aunt Carla standing there, plus the mediator. The self-realization I�ve been avoiding for months hit me like a ton of bricks�for my own good, before it�s too late, I desperately need to get my social life on track,� said Sheehorn, who was forced to face how far gone he is when his sisters Meghan and Candice texted 45 minutes late to say they couldn�t attend. �Knowing that hardly anyone showed up for me in my darkest moments is exactly the motivation I need to make big changes. Starting today, no more excuses. I refuse to let my addiction prevent me from finally making more friends at work or my rec basketball league.� Sheehorn has since made a resolution to throw away his pills and find a more social drug to abuse."
"Expressing happiness that their matriarch had finally �gotten into the swing of things,� the family of grandmother Ellen Haan confirmed Monday that the 87-year-old had really started to get the hang of dying in recent weeks. �Nana�s just recently come to grips with this whole diminishing-into-nothingness deal, and one of the things we all love about her is that once she decides to do something, by God she�s going to do it right,� said Haan�s grandson Mark Conroy, noting that although the octogenarian had initially struggled with the finer points of departing forever from this earth, she seems to have really hit her stride since Christmas. �Her big turning point came just after Thanksgiving when she began suffering cascading organ failures. Since then, there�s been no stopping her. I have to admit she makes shuffling off this mortal coil look easy. The whole family is very impressed.� Haan is expected to perfect her skills at dying sometime early next week."
"Terrified that their greatest fear has become a disgusting reality, new parents Melanie and Abe Bloom confirmed Monday that their newborn son Levi is, in fact, the type of baby who shits. �We had hoped that Levi would have a recessive shitting gene, and when that turned out not to be the case, we thought perhaps his incessant shitting was a birth trauma thing that would subside after the first three weeks, but no matter what we do, he simply won�t stop. It�s horrible,� said the infant�s mother, adding that their son�s virtual fecal hose runs at full volume regardless of whether he breastfeeds or takes formula, even when the child is just napping. �I guess I�m not completely surprised, considering we waited so long to have children, but for us, adapting to a baby who shits has been an ordeal. I�m told that plenty of people who shat constantly and uncontrollably as children have grown up to lead perfectly normal lives, but given where we�re at right now, I don�t know. Levi�s father shits, too, so we assume that�s where he gets it from, but I�ve made appointments with a number of pediatric specialists because this is just really gross.� At press time, the couple was trying to conceive again in order to have a normal baby."
"Restroom attendee Sean O�Donnell recoiled internally Monday while regarding the painted-over portion of the PATH train bathroom wall where he could only assume some truly egregious and revolting graffiti had been written. �Stuff like, �Kimmy S sucked my cock� and �Die all cops� is still plainly visible in this stall. It makes you wonder what kind of deranged shit they decided to cover up,� said O�Donnell, speculating that the most vile and hateful slurs imaginable were once scrawled on the wall for all the world to see. �Jesus Christ, there�s still a ton of crudely drawn genitals, the word �faggot,� and a couple swastikas. Most of the graffiti in here is pretty damn unsettling�I can only imagine that whatever they got rid of was fucked up beyond belief.� O�Donnell refused to speculate what horrifying imagery might be beneath the spots of the wall covered in blood, excrement, and urine."
"After briefly considering surfaces such as the nightstand, the bookshelf, the toilet tank, and the top of the refrigerator, party guest Ryan Brown decided Friday that the bedroom dresser was probably where the host wanted everyone to leave their empty beer cans. �Someone just left a PBR on the floor�rude�but I�m pretty confident [party organizer] Natalie meant for them to be up here, between a framed photo of her nephew and a lamp,� said Brown, adding that she would most likely want attendees to crush the cans beforehand, allowing residual amounts of liquid to spill out and dry on the wood surface. �Obviously, we�re supposed to pour the dregs of our beverages into this potted plant, but where would she prefer I put any pull tabs that separated from their cans? Logically, also on the dresser. I left a collection of them in her kitchen sink last time, but I was pretty drunk. Common sense says she�d want them right here on the cherry chest of drawers.� Brown eventually noticed a collection of various drink containers piling up in a difficult-to-reach area behind the couch and was inspired to drop his empty can there."
"Expressing his concern that the relationships may be based on obligation rather than real friendship, local man Alec Crawford told reporters Tuesday that he was beginning to think that the only reason people were hanging out with him was because they were all on the same jury. �Sure, we all get lunch together and we�ve been pretty much inseparable for the last couple weeks, but there�s some part of me that can�t help but feel they�re only putting up with me because they�re legally required to do so,� said Crawford, admitting that he couldn�t quite shake the sense that they never would have met up at that bar the night before if they weren�t all sequestered in the same hotel for the duration of the trial. �Everybody has been cool, but there have been little tip-offs here and there that they might be more interested in their civic duty than nurturing the special bond we�ve formed. For example, a lot of them still refer to me as �Juror 4,� and while they�re always happy to talk about what we might be getting for dinner that evening, as soon as I start trying to make plans for a weekend trip after the trial ends, everyone�s suddenly super vague and non-committal.� Crawford also noted that he had no reservations about his blossoming friendship with the defense attorney who had eagerly engaged him in numerous late-night conversations about how his client was innocent."
"Speculating that he probably should not want to maintain his current lifestyle forever, local man Greg Schatz, 34, expressed concerns Tuesday about possibly being stuck in an endless cycle of excessive drinking, hard partying, and generally having a good time. �Slowly, without my even realizing it, my life has entered a big feedback loop. Day after day, week after week, I go out, I drink until I haven�t a care in the world, I have incredible experiences with great friends I love very much, and then later, I come to feeling absolutely fantastic and I want nothing more than to do it all over again,� said Schatz, who claimed he was worried that someday he will look back on a life consisting of nothing but incredible experiences, enduring personal connections, and amazing memories. �I always tell myself this is the last Thursday I�ll go out for cocktails and end up having a blast, but then I find myself right back doing the same incredibly enjoyable things with people I love the very next weekend. I might stop for a week or two, but eventually, I fall back into the cycle of joy and celebration, and I�m worried that�s all there is to my life. I mean, I know a guy who�s in his mid-40s who still goes out and lives it up with his friends all the time, and he�s perfectly well-adjusted and content in every way. I don�t want to end up like that.� Schatz openly admitted that many of his fears come from watching his father�s ongoing struggle with happiness."
"Saying it would likely be no big deal to skip her monthly phone call, Rhea Mann, 47, decided Tuesday that after five years, she was allowed to quietly lose touch with paramedic Eric Seversen, who saved the life of her son Brian in 2014. �At first, I�d be sending him flowers for Brian�s birthday or for Christmas and writing him long, thankful emails, but at this point, I don�t think we still have to invite his family over for an uncomfortable dinner party once a year,� said Mann, who was reasonably certain that she could just send Seversen the family Christmas card and pretty much leave it at that. �What are we supposed to keep talking about? Do we even have common interests? All I really say is, �Yeah, so, Brian�s 14 now,� and, �Our family is so grateful you got to the skate park so fast.� Also, to be perfectly honest, it�s not like he went above and beyond the call of duty. Any EMT would have done the same thing. It�s just his job.� Mann later decided to maintain contact after receiving a spontaneous text from Seversen saying how grateful he was to have her family in his life."
"Casting serious doubt over his commitment, self-professed atheist Edward Horvath came under intense scrutiny Monday after sources revealed that despite ample opportunities, he has never once barged into local churches screaming that the parishioners are all �brainwashed fools.� �This guy fancies himself some kind of true non-believer, but I�d bet my imaginary soul he�s never snatched a Bible out of a stranger�s hands and ripped out the pages one by one,� said roommate Dan Taylor, also a self-professed atheist, in regard to the surprisingly non-confrontational 32-year-old, noting that Horvath has never once stood atop a pew during Sunday mass screaming that the whole charade was all a colossal lie. �Ed might pay lip service to atheism, but does he regularly accuse people who are wearing crucifixes in public for glorifying the torture of a Jewish carpenter�who, by the way, may not have ever existed? Has he ever thrown communion wine to the floor and called those receiving it deluded lotus eaters? No. We could never rely on this guy to storm into a packed worship service and dare the congregation�s imaginary God to strike him down while calling them all pawns in this sick little game of faith.� At press time, several members of the atheist community said they were �done with� Horvath after photographs came to light showing him smiling in a church during his brother�s wedding ceremony."
"Wavering over which of the two activities would be most fulfilling to pursue, local teen Ethan Horne told reporters Friday that he was on the verge of either joining ISIS or getting super into rollerblading. �I�ve been desperately searching for some meaning in my life, and it�s really beginning to look like I�m going to fill the void by moving to Syria to help establish a global caliphate or starting to focus on rollerblading way more seriously,� said Horne, who has been actively weighing whether it would be more gratifying to go to the park and practice heel toes, crossovers, and skating backwards or wage jihad on the West by beheading an infidel. �It�s a kind of a tough decision because I�ve been watching a lot of suicide bombing videos that have been a really huge influence, but then again, I went rollerblading the other day and had a total blast. I�m still on the fence because both rollerblading and ISIS have, like, these super close, tight-knit communities.� At press time, Horne had reportedly packed his roller blades into his suitcase after realizing that there was nothing stopping him from doing both."
"Following delivery of the sealed, handwritten letters to every member of the cast, it reportedly remained unclear Thursday why stagehand Kirk Weiland had composed heartfelt little notes to all the actors who appeared in the Leander Playhouse�s staging of The Sound Of Music. �I think I was introduced to him at some point during the production, but other than that, I don�t recall ever interacting with him,� said Gina Kelsey, who portrayed Maria von Trapp and, like each of her castmates, expressed bafflement on the last night of the show�s run when she received a personalized message from Weiland written in a neat hand on nice-looking stationery. �In the note, he addresses me as �Gina the Machina,� which is weird, because no one�s ever called me that before. Then he goes on to say he�ll always remember how hard we laughed when [castmate] Mallory [Tyler] auditioned for Mother Abbess, but I really don�t remember him or any of the crew being around for that. I suppose I might have said hello to him once or twice during tech week, but I honestly can�t say I know him otherwise.� At press time, sources confirmed Weiland was standing near the hors d�oeuvre table at the closing-night cast party and had yet to make eye contact with anyone."
"Expressing outrage at the obnoxious programming he�d be forced to sit through for the next several hours, local dog Tuffy reportedly couldn�t believe his owner had left the television tuned to fucking MSNBC Thursday to keep him company while she was working. �Jesus Christ, how does she expect me to watch this inane garbage all day?� said the 3-year-old labrador retriever mix, whining and burrowing his head into a pile of clothes under his owner�s bed in an effort to drown out the noise of Hallie Jackson interviewing Adam Schiff. �I have extremely sensitive ears, so I�m forced to listen to every last DNC talking point getting spoon-fed to me by these dumbasses. They�re so sanctimonious, I can�t handle it for much longer. I swear to God, if she�s not home before Chris Matthews comes on the air, I�m shitting all over the rug. I don�t understand how this doesn�t count as animal abuse.� At press time, Tuffy had reportedly knocked over his owner�s computer in a desperate attempt to get some ideological diversity by listening to Jordan B. Peterson�s podcast."
"Upon hearing his friends describing their struggles with the mental illness, self-employed graphic designer Jacob Carden, 42, evidently became competitive Wednesday about how depressed he is by rattling off a list of important life and career events the disorder has ruined for him or caused him to miss altogether. �Oh, you�ve been stuck in bed until noon? That sucks, I know, I�ve had trouble getting up for months. I�ll be in bed until 2 or even 3 p.m. sometimes. I�m envious, really, because I�ll be pretty much unable to leave my room for days on end,� said Carden, adding that while some people have seasonal affective disorder, his clinical depression effectively caused him to experience its effects year-round. �I�ve struggled with these feelings since I was super young, too�I remember feeling a profound sadness when I was, like, 5. My whole family has it, so it�s likely genetic and not merely a chemical thing. My shitty home situation forced me to develop self-destructive coping mechanisms growing up. Not that I�ve neglected the chemical side of things�I�ve tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Effexor, Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lamictal, Abilify, Vivactil, Cymbalta, and a bunch of others. They work for some people, but not me, I guess, despite increasing therapy sessions to twice a week to deal with suicidal ideation. Your constant low-grade depression and dysthymia sounds great to me, especially in contrast to how my cycling thing makes it impossible to manage what with the panic attacks, which are especially troubling given my family�s history of bipolar disorder and stuff. You don�t struggle with anxiety, do you?� Carden was eventually forced to concede to an acquaintance, who recounted, at some length and with remarkable detail, her struggles with OCD."
"Appearing inexplicably mesmerized by the unremarkable scenery below, Delta flight 2127 passenger Richard Hart, 38, was glued to the window of the Airbus A321 �like it was fucking 1956,� travellers confirmed Tuesday. �Jesus, this guy is staring out that window as if the miracle of aviation was bestowed upon mankind just this morning,� said Hart�s row 27 seat-mate Hannah Gordon, who noted that the �goddamned simpleton� had audibly exclaimed in delight before making a �dumbass� observation about how small everything looked. �C�mon dude. We�re not flying PanAm in the golden age. We�re flying from Denver to Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, this dope is gaping at every cloud like he�s the third goddamn Wright brother. You�d think we were flying over the world�s fair or something. He�s even dressed up like he�s expecting a leggy stewardess to bring him a martini and light his cigarette before we land at Idlewild. What an asshole.� Airline sources confirm that Gordon spent the flight enjoying the Mark Wahlberg comedy Instant Family like a decent person."
"Noting the couple�s dull conversation and bored expressions while dining at the otherwise enchanting Pepper Tree Restaurant, bystanders marked all the telltale signs of a terrible first date Tuesday as Crystal and Jacob Rubens celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary at a quiet, candlelit table. �Look how miserable they are, playing on their phones and sitting in awkward silence. She�s probably waiting for the famous �escape text� from a friend to get her out of this mess,� said witnesses of the married couple, who recently moved into a larger home in the suburbs to accommodate their third child. �They clearly have nothing in common except their TV shows, which are pretty much the only thing they�ve talked about this whole time. Whichever one of their friends set them up on this disaster of a blind date is probably an asshole. I�m so glad I�m not single anymore. I don�t have to deal with that shit.� Jacob then presented Crystal with a small but practical gift, which the onlookers noted was �embarrassing� and �desperate� for a first date."
"Regaling her sister�s sons with previously untold stories from adolescence, local aunt Sherri Neely scored big Monday with her nephews Bobby and Ben Cecil by dropping the bombshell story about their mother smoking weed as a teenager. �You should have seen their faces when I told them about me and Marci getting high in the Van Halen concert parking lot back in July of �81. They were hanging on every goddamn word,� said Neely, who delighted in sharing the detailed account of the night the woman, whom the 15-year-old and 17-year-old know as �Mom,� called in sick to her summer grocery store cashier gig, bought three joints from a total stranger on the bus ride to Boston Garden, and smoked them in the parking lot before and after the show. �At first, they said, �Yeah, right, Aunt Sherri, Mom is no fun and she hates music,� but then I told them about how their mom actually became known around school for rolling these perfect little pin joints. I can�t wait to tell them about the time we hitchhiked to New York with the guys who made our fake IDs. They�ll go nuts.� Neely added that if the boys promised to be good, she�d tell them how their parents met on the night their dad sold their mom acid outside the bowling alley where he worked."
"Awestruck by the sight of their longtime colleague struggling out of his jacket and adjusting his cuffs, coworkers found themselves agog Monday as data analyst Drew Terrell introduced a new shirt into his wardrobe rotation. �Oh, my God, he got a new shirt,� said Terrell�s cubicle neighbor Kelly Brennan, accurately summing up the sentiments of her officemates, all of whom could be seen murmuring and nodding amongst themselves due to the article of clothing. �Tell me you�ve seen Drew�s shirt? Come on, scoot over so you can get a better look. See? He is wearing it now. Powder blue.� At press time, sources confirmed Terrell�s colleagues would be disappointed later in the week when the data analyst arrived for work in one of his old and previously worn shirts."
"Insisting none of the myriad souvenirs before him could possibly capture the all-inclusive resort�s fantastic buffet, local man Robert Washburn told reporters Wednesday he feared his Cancun vacation was far too complex to be conveyed through a single keychain. �Yes, of course, it�s true that I �heart� Mexico, but are any of these tchotchkes able to express the pure magic of snorkeling with my wife and the nice couple we met from Columbus, OH?� said Washburn, adding that neither the gift shop�s Yucat�n refrigerator magnet, nor its Calavera shot glass, nor its miniature sombrero could ever paint a picture so vivid as to evoke how one feels taking a disposable camera photograph of their 8-year-old daughter getting her hair braided. �However exquisite this bracelet made of tiny maracas may be, are its pinks and blues anything more than pale shades of the sunset observed from Se�or Frogs� outdoor seating area? Does this 1-inch ceramic turtle not offer its owner a fraction of the scintillating rush one only experiences at Riviera Maya�s Extreme Zipline and Canopy Adventure?� At press time, Washburn was satisfied after purchasing a fitted baseball cap with the Mexican flag on it."
"Visibly wincing while watching the sensei�s assistant being slammed repeatedly to the tatami mat, onlookers at Buckeye Aikido Academy confirmed Wednesday that understudy Barry Eiselmann was getting his ass absolutely whipped during a demonstration of basic takedowns. �Wow, he just fucking threw him on the ground,� said student Neal Davis, who expressed surprise that what he had assumed would be a quick demonstration grew to more than half an hour of watching Eiselmann get �absolutely dismantled� by various Yoshinkan techniques. �At first, it seemed Barry was just being deferential, but now it�s clear he�s in serious pain. I learned how to properly execute an arm pin, but that was 20 minutes ago. The real takeaway is that it�s a big mistake to attack sensei.� In possibly related news, Davis has been enlisted to help Eiselmann demonstrate a proper rotary throw after the assistant spotted him speaking to reporters."
"Saying he�d definitely need a lot more of a �hook� to captivate a courtroom, local attorney Ari Berkley reportedly told her character witness Tuesday that he just doesn�t have what it takes to be a star witness. �Look�you�ve got great delivery, and you�re clearly passionate about the case, but I�m not really sure you have the look you�d need to win over a jury,� said Berkley, adding that while every witness may want to be the leading man of their trial, the chances of even making it onto court TV are slim to none. �Honestly, no matter how good you are now, it could take years of testifying against unnamed sources or anonymous tipsters before you hit it big time and make it to the big screen. Even someone like Kato Kaelin needed coaching, and that was for the trial of the century��! Sorry, kid, I want your name in lights as much as anyone, but some people simply aren�t born for the stand.� At press time, Berkley recommended her witness try joining some smaller community trials in his hometown rather than moving to Los Angeles and getting lost in their huge court system."
"Saying it was standard for any expecting mother�s 20-week checkup, ultrasound technician Jean Krebacher asked one of her pregnant patients Tuesday if she would like to know the name of her unborn child. �This is the moment of truth�I can tell you the first name now, or you can wait to find out until delivery,� said Krebacher, assuring the mother that no matter what, she should rest easy because the child had developed a normal three-syllable signifier, and its vowels were forming perfectly according to schedule. �It�s totally up to you. If you want it to be a surprise, I won�t tell you. But if you�re planning on doing a name-reveal party, I can write it on a slip of paper and put it in an envelope for you to open whenever you want.� At press time, Krebacher reportedly had to comfort the sobbing mother after revealing that her baby would be born a Gunther."
"Shaking their heads in disgust at the irresponsible man�s laziness and lack of initiative, sources disclosed to reporters Monday that impoverished 53-year-old Luke Reilly has never earned passive income from stock dividends a day in his life. �It�s an absolute disgrace that there are people in this country who can�t even be bothered to get up and go out and put some of their cash on hand into high dividend�yielding stocks,� said local resident Deborah Nix, who expressed frustration at the full-time cashier�s refusal to even try investing in a mutual fund or placing a substantial inheritance into an account that generates thousands of dollars a year and can then be tapped into as needed. �He probably just expects everything to be handed to him, but that�s not how it works. You have to get out there and pound the pavement until you find a reputable wealth management firm. Then, it�s just a matter of following the advice of an expert and transferring funds from one place to another. Of course, if someone like that ever did�receive a dividend payout or a generous share buyback, he�d probably blow it all by the end of the week.� At press time, sources confirmed Reilly had proven his neighbor�s point by squandering his entire minimum-wage paycheck on rent, bills, and groceries."
"Noticeably confused when his face lit up at the mere mention of her name, the Snyder family admitted Monday to being unsure as to exactly why Paul Swensen, the eldercare nurse employed as the caregiver to their grandmother Ruth, genuinely seems to enjoy spending time with her. �He talks and jokes with Grandma Ruthie like they�re old pals, which is weird, since she�s basically been fairly out of it for the last five years. If I didn�t know any better, I�d swear he even likes her,� said 39-year-old Alan Snyder, bewildered by the nurse�s apparently honest interest in hearing his elderly nana repeat the same stories over and over without becoming annoyed. �I get that we�re paying him, but seriously�to appreciate her company and listen to her talk about her day? Really? Every month or so when we show up, he acts the same way, and I�m like, hey, we�re here now, drop the act and go take a smoke break or something. Does he think if he�s nice to her, he�ll get written into the will?� At press time, the Snyder family was baffled that the caregiver became distraught after their grandmother quietly passed away."
"Observing how the pair had infused the entire establishment with a savage sexual energy, patrons of Belmont Karaoke Bar speculated Thursday that the couple performing a duet of �Suddenly Seymour� were probably going to fuck like animals immediately afterwards. �Oh, man, the chemistry between those two? No way they�re not gonna hustle out of here right after this and just go to town on each other,� said witness Garrett Walsh, citing the palpable lust between the performers of the iconic number from Little Shop Of Horrors, particularly the manner in which they gazed hungrily at one another during the song�s chorus. �They�re really pouring everything they�ve got into this. At this rate, I�ll be surprised if they don�t just duck into the bathroom, rip their clothes off, and rut like goats. Hell, I�m so turned on just watching them I probably shouldn�t drive home.� Upon bringing the song to a remarkably torrid conclusion, the performers and coworkers reportedly returned to their group table to drink heavily and avoid eye contact for the rest of the night."
"Visibly annoyed after his auction closed with a winning bid far below his expectations, actor Matt Damon begrudgingly accepted $50 Monday from the eBay auction of his cast and crew jacket from the sci-fi thriller The Martian. �I sort of don�t want to part with my only memento from my time on that set, but I really need the cash,� said Damon, noting that other than a grape fruit juice stain on its left sleeve, the jacket was in near-mint condition and should sell for �way more� given its connection to a real Hollywood movie. �I had assumed there would be a bidding war or something, but almost no one bit. And I was banking on using the cash from this to cover my acting classes. As it is, I�m actually losing a little money on the whole thing. I should have never agreed to pay shipping on this.� Damon�s mood reportedly changed to anger after learning the person who bought the jacket resold the item in two days later for $475."
"Stepping off the curb and into the crosswalk, local man Adam Hartsell reportedly made sure to look up at the driver of an approaching vehicle Thursday to ensure they would feel extra guilty in the event they failed to stop and ran him over. �The goal of this split-second eye contact is to impress my image upon their mind, so that if they do hit me, they will be forced to spend the rest of their days picturing the terrified face of the person they ran over in his last moments of life,� said the 26-year-old pedestrian, who emphasized the importance of not only locking eyes with each and every oncoming driver, but also delivering a hard stare that conveys a stern moral appraisal of any who would not brake their vehicle in time. �In this way, I will be able to haunt their dreams long after they�ve struck and killed me. If I have enough time, I also make sure to look any passengers dead in the eyes, so that they, too, will be hounded for years by debilitating remorse. It�s important to take these small precautions.� At press time, reports confirmed the oncoming driver had looked up from their phone screen and briefly wondered what the muffled noise coming from beneath their car had been."
"Confused and unsettled after an employee at the clothing retailer called her by her name, area woman Christine Forberg, 28, confirmed she had no memory of telling the dressing room attendant at a local Gap store who she was. �She unlocked a dressing room for me and said �Let me know if you need any other sizes, Christine,� which was weird, because I swear I didn�t introduce myself,� said the visibly shaken Forberg, carefully reconstructing every moment she�d spent in the store thus far�from entering it, to selecting a pair of size-eight dress slacks, to approaching the fitting rooms�to assure herself she hadn�t at any point given the woman her name. �She even wrote �Christine� on the little chalkboard on the door. And then, when she came back a few minutes later with a shirt she thought I�d like, she called me �Ms. Forberg�! At first I thought maybe I was still wearing my ID badge from work, but nope. What the hell?� At press time, reports confirmed Forberg had made a hasty exit from the store after the clerk referred to her by a private nickname thought to be known only to her boyfriend."
"Lamenting the heedless manner in which you handled a most cherished accoutrement, sources opined Wednesday that Papa shall be so very cross you�ve lost Grandfather�s hunting cap. �Papa will simply throw a fit, a very conniption or temper, to learn that his own father�s homburg�as fine a specimen of the haberdasher�s craft as one could hope to see, with a lovely emerald Panamanian woodpecker�s feather set jauntily aslant in the band�that this hat of the very world, as it were, has been lost forever,� said Mother, entreating you to be more ruminative in your comportment, for Papa took great pride in displaying Grandfather�s hunting cap, the aforementioned charcoal-brimmed Lock & Co., with its chestnut gutter crown encircled by a grosgrain band of dark crimson, which you abandoned as one would a parcel of rubbish. �I do beg you, on my love for you and for your own sake: Be more vigilant in your care of our heirlooms. For Father holds it as very Scripture that he who would lose a hat would lose an estate; and this season has been ever so hard for him that I fear the loss of his hunting cap will leave him utterly melancholic. And however shall Papa lead the Easter fox hunt without his full complement of sporting attire? That cap was gifted to Grandfather by his dear friend Hugo Reisinger, that selfsame Herr Doktor Reisinger who co-devised the mercurial-barometric storm-glass, and now, thanks to your negligence, the coachman�s brats are no doubt cutting ear-holes in the felting of its brim, that it may better fit atop their mule. Oh, no. Do you hear that? I fear Papa�s carriage draws near, and with it, a reckoning.� Fearing that you may soon be forced to bear the worst of Papa�s more base and physical humours, Mother has advised you to take your leave for now and find occupation in the library while she endeavored to determine whether Grandfather�s hunting cap could yet be retrieved."
"Explaining that his frequent visits to the creatures helped give him a much-needed sense of perspective in his old age, Louis Ross, 78, confirmed Wednesday that he fought feelings of loneliness by visiting the families of ducks at his local pond and savagely pelting them with rocks. �It�s so calm out here, so quiet, and that really puts my mind at ease,� said Ross, recounting his daily ritual of sitting down at his favorite bench by the water and trying to hit as many ducks as possible until either the sun goes down or he runs out of rocks. �I�ve been coming here so often that the ducks know it�s me as soon as I arrive. You form such a special relationship with a flock of animals when you see the terror move from bird to bird. You even start recognizing the looks in their eyes. I try to give equal attention to all of them, but I have to admit I do have a favorite. See that one with the notch in his beak? I gave him that. Felt a bond with him ever since. I always try to nail him with the biggest rock. Feels like I owe it to him.� At press time, Ross was elated to learn that several of the ducks had recently hatched another few dozen ducklings."
"Revealing that the victims� deaths had come, like, completely out of nowhere, authorities confirmed Monday that seven total randos had been found dead. �All seven were discovered last night within a few miles of each other, leading investigators to just go, um, what?� said Police Chief Ware O�Malley, telling reporters that detectives had been unable to identify those killed but believed they had likely spent their last moments hanging out being big weirdos. �As of this time, we are still figuring out what their whole deal was, but we can definitively state that the circumstances surrounding their demise were hella sketchy. I mean, hello, who just dies out in the woods like that?� At press time, the case had reportedly become super awkward after the cause of death in all seven cases was ruled to be blunt force trauma to the skull."
"In a devastatingly sad overestimation of his influence in the professional world, local father Bruce Tenety, 54, expressed the heartbreaking belief Monday that his connections could help his son Justin, a recent college graduate, find a job. �You know, I actually have a friend in the media business, and if you shoot him an email and meet up for coffee, he just might be able to hook you up with something,� said Tenety, who depressingly appeared to be under the impression that this tenuous contact from a conference he attended three years ago would not only remember his name, but would also be willing to extend an offer of employment to a 23-year-old he knows nothing about. �I also know a guy who works at a PR firm in Mayfield Heights. Old Gary definitely owes me one from back in the day. Hell, you could probably call him up right now and get an interview this week. Just tell him you�re Bruce�s kid.� At press time, sources confirmed Tenety had noticed his name was suspiciously absent from the references section on his son�s most recent job application."
"Saying that she was still adjusting to the physical aftereffects of her difficult childbirth, new mother Tina Quinn admitted Friday she was still a bit self-conscious about the scar where Skyler, her healthy 7-pound, 8-ounce newborn, punched his way out of her stomach. �I know it�s kind of a silly thing to worry about, but I feel like it looks weird�I just don�t feel comfortable wearing a bikini anymore,� said Quinn, lamenting that numerous home remedies, including vitamin E and coconut oil, had thus far failed to reduce the severity of the scar network webbed across her lower abdomen. �It was still the best day of my life, and I�d happily have my Skyler claw and gnash his way out of me again in a heartbeat, but it�s been challenging. Especially when some people judge you for not choosing to give birth the �traditional� way.� Quinn also expressed gratitude that she suffered less scarring than a close friend who has yet to be released from the hospital after an 18-hour labor during which her baby slowly head-butted his way out of the womb."
"In what economists are calling a �significant infusion of cash� for the three-bedroom duplex, area parents Kevin and Elaine Broward have pumped $66 dollars into the economy of a local apartment, sources confirmed Thursday. �We expect this stimulus to be a real boon to household spending, with tenants perhaps replenishing paper towel, hand soap, and Swiffer Sweeper pad supplies,� said economist Cassidy Ellis-Smith of Moody�s Analytics, who predicted the funds, received as a reimbursement for fuel expenses incurred by roommate Sam Broward, 24, during a recent trip to see his parents, could increase consumer confidence in the household throughout the weekend. �An influx of capital like this should be more than enough to cover groceries, perhaps even providing the liquidity necessary to purchase a floor lamp for the living room.� At press time, economists confirmed they were revising their projections after the tenants had opted to spend $64.38 on Kingdom Hearts III."
"Admitting that this week�s extreme wind chills were starting to get to her, Minnesota resident Anne Mauer confirmed Tuesday that she�s seriously thinking of packing it all up and moving somewhere warm like Michigan. �The winters here can be so brutal. Maybe it�s about time I go someplace down south like Detroit or Kalamazoo,� said Mauer, adding that she had even applied to a few jobs in Iowa but worried it�d be too far from her friends and family back home. �I visited my sister in Ohio last Christmas, and the lowest it ever got there was, like, 10 degrees. It was so nice. Supposedly, they only had, like, two and a half feet of snow all winter. That�s what I want.� At press time, Mauer had given up plans to move and settled instead on a week-long vacation in Rochester."
"Finding themselves unable to explain the mystery woman�s presence in the lunchroom, grade-school sources confirmed Tuesday that older cafeteria monitor Esther Lowry was not a teacher or parent or anything. �Mrs. Makings volunteers in our classroom sometimes because she�s Josh�s mom, but Mrs. Lowry is here every day and she�s not even anyone�s grandma, so maybe this is her job,� said mystified first-grader Koby Zeiff, noting that the elderly woman once yelled at him for running, and therefore may work for the school despite not having any familial connections to anyone at Desert Springs Elementary. �All the other grown-ups here are teachers or helpers, so she must have, like, tried for this job. She got pretty mad when Hannah threw her sandwich on the floor last week, so she�s kind of acting like a teacher. Maybe she wants to be a teacher? It�s just weird. She doesn�t seem to like kids all that much.� Upon being contacted, school officials said they did not know where Mrs. Lowry came from either."
"Claiming that anyone with even a little bit of pride in their company would have dismissed such a terrible employee by now, telemarketer David Baker, 29, said Tuesday that he was losing respect for the �obviously incompetent� boss who continues not to fire him. �He called me into his office about a month ago. It was really the perfect time to tell me I should get a box and pack up my desk, but no, just another heartfelt inquiry into whether or not I�m feeling motivated. Disappointing,� said Baker, maintaining that �any idiot� should be able to see that retaining someone like him was a complete drain on company resources, not to mention the negative impact on the coworkers who must listen to his malingering while they constantly pick up his slack. �Any respect or admiration I might have once felt for my boss is completely lost. I�ve never seen anyone so inept at their job, and, to be honest, I�m really concerned for the future of this company. I wish he were more like my last supervisor who took less than two weeks to recognize I had no idea what I was doing and fire me.� When reached for further comment, Baker confirmed that he had been promoted."
"Insisting that this, right now, is the moment to get in on the ground floor if you want to �make bank,� local brother-in-law Doug Mooreland recounted Monday to all available family members that he has, in fact, heard that one can make �a shitload of money� doing that. �I mean, even if you�re only, like, halfway decent at it�and really, it doesn�t seem that hard�you can make just a fuck ton of money. I heard one of the early guys who tried this thing, I mean, he worked pretty hard and it was the early days and all, but he retired at, I wanna say 40? And now he lives on his boat,� said Mooreland, clarifying that the only things you need to get started are a reliable vehicle, some specialized equipment, and a bunch of friends. �You barely even have to work once you get it all rolling. Just sit back and collect what they call �passive income.� I�m talking big money, man. So I�ve actually been thinking, it sounds like the real deal and, y�know, maybe you want to get in on this together?� At press time, Mooreland was also asking friends and family members if, long story short, he could sleep on their couch for a few nights, call it a week max."
"Visibly upset by the lengthy conversation with her paternal grandmother, bistro manager Allison Boyer, 24, admitted Monday that her grandmother�s #MeToo stories of daily life as a single woman in the 1950s and �60s were �fucking horrifying.� �All I did was ask her about what her life was like before she met Grandpa when she was working as a typist for a fertilizer factory manager. I didn�t start out to ask her about sexual harassment, but Jesus Christ�she just matter-of-fact told me some stuff that scared the shit out of me,� said Boyer, explaining that she was sickened to learn that a male coworker lifting up a woman�s skirt, a boss forcefully kissing a female employee at a holiday party, or a total stranger pinching a fellow restaurant patron�s rear end was a disturbingly regular occurrence during what 84-year-old Gwendolyn Boyer described, with obvious nostalgia, as her �heyday.� �Grandma rattled off a list of stuff that happened either to her or someone she knew, things we�d call stalking, intimidation, and full-on assault. Just the comments men would make on a woman�s appearance, comments that were considered �normal� at the time, were jaw-droppingly horrendous.� Upon learning that her grandmother had said �no� to her grandfather five times before finally agreeing to go out with him, Boyer considered the possibility that her grandmother does not realize she is in fact telling #MeToo stories."
"Commenting upon the odd feeling produced by the chance encounter, local teenager Evelyn Hildebrand confided to reporters Thursday that she was �totally weirded out� after running over her English teacher, Ted Miller, outside of school. �It took me by surprise because he just kind of appeared out of nowhere, and I�m not used to seeing Mr. Miller like that,� said the high school junior, adding that she was startled when Miller suddenly stepped into the crosswalk, and that she wasn�t certain whether the 32-year-old educator recognized his student in the split second before the car smashed into him and drove over his body. �At first, I wasn�t even sure it was him. He�s always very reserved and formal when he�s teaching, so it was strange to come across him in a completely different situation like that, one where he was covered in blood and writhing. It was pretty awkward. I just tried to get out of there as quick as I could.� At press time, Hildebrand confirmed she was crossing her fingers in the hope Miller wouldn�t bring up the incident when he had recovered to the point where he was able to return to class."
"Frustrated that his local police precinct was shirking responsibilities, a masked vigilante confirmed Thursday that he would be taking the work of terrorizing the black community into his own hands as long as law enforcement officers failed to do so. �It�s become crystal clear that our police won�t do their duty, so it�s up to me to set things right by fulfilling the function of law and enforcement and making these streets unsafe for the so-called �black community,�� the vigilante told passersby from underneath a ski mask, elaborating at length how he could no longer sit idly by while his hometown became a place where white people became a minority in their own country and decent folk can�t even go into the library without seeing members of other races. �Thanks to the cops deciding that black people simply walking down the street aren�t worth their attention, I hardly even recognize my own home town. Why don�t the police do their jobs and stop and frisk all these black people? I guess it falls on my own two shoulders to get the community back on track.� At press time, law enforcement officials had arrested several victims of the masked vigilante."
"After a biopsy determined a tumor removed from his kidney was benign, local 28-year-old Andrew Keller was reportedly reassured by doctors Wednesday that he still had quite a few years of staring at his smartphone ahead of him. �Good news: The tests came back completely negative, which means you�ll be mindlessly scrolling through the apps on your phone for decades to come,� said Saint Luke�s Hospital nephrologist Elizabeth Steltzer, adding that she had feared the mass in Keller�s kidney might have been renal cell carcinoma, a disease that could rob him of years spent hunching over electronic devices and gazing vacantly into their screens. �My prognosis is that you�ll be scanning your feeds and tapping on touch-screen devices for a long, long time. With any luck, you�ll get to watch your kids and grandkids grow up to stare at their phones, too.� At press time, sources confirmed Steltzer was repeating the positive report to Keller, who appeared to have become distracted after receiving a new Twitter notification."
"Saying she�d �psyched herself out� during the last few story times at her local library, area puppet Phoebe the Pig admitted to reporters Wednesday that due to nerves, she had no idea what to do with her hands. �The minute I got out there in front of the kids, I felt uncomfortable. It was like my arms were just hanging there or sticking out at weird angles,� said Phoebe, noting that even gestures like waves, friendly handshakes, or throwing her hands in front of her eyes for a quick game of peek-a-boo didn�t feel natural anymore. �Sometimes, I feel odd just standing still, so I�ll start clapping or high-fiving people like an idiot. And, honestly, the more I think about it, the worse it gets. Yesterday, I had no idea what to do, so I just started dancing. The kids wouldn�t stop laughing.� At press time, Phoebe added that she had managed to stop some of her nervous fidgeting by simply putting her hands inside of her mouth."
"Presenting a romanticized snapshot of regional biodiversity, a local nature preserve reportedly set highly unrealistic expectations Monday with a visitor center full of taxidermied animals. �Whoa, a beaver, a timber wolf, and a pack of bobcats just chilling on a rock,� said first-time visitor Stephanie Coughlin, admitting with glee that she always dreamed about �getting up close and personal� with a black bear, a badger, and an elk. �Check out all those bald eagles! There�s, like, five of them next to that moose and those flying squirrels. Wait, is that a river otter? Fuck yeah! How did I miss out on all of this? I mean, I�ve never seen anything larger than a possum, and I�ve lived in the Minneapolis suburbs for, like, 30 years.� At press time, a dejected Coughlin learned that she would be spending the next two hours dissecting owl pellets."
"Telling himself the wisest course of action was to avoid all eye contact and let the chips fall where they may, weird kid Jason Butler opted Tuesday to sit perfectly still and let the universe determine his destiny after his chemistry teacher instructed students to select a partner for their next assignment. �I shall let the cosmos decide, for only a fool would attempt to escape the hand of fate,� said the 12-year-old middle school student and weirdo, resolving not to move a muscle as those around him got up from their seats and found friends to pair up with. �I will be conveyed to my new lab partner like a cork upon the ocean waves, ebbing and flowing with the tide, my path guided only by Poseidon�s will. What will be, will be.� At press time, Butler was overheard muttering, �Oh, fuck this,� upon having to partner with the only other unpaired student, a 14-year-old loser taking the class for the third time."
"Noting that his four years at Fordham University hadn�t even led to a 3,000-square-foot penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side yet, local 24-year-old Alex Michaelson, who still hasn�t achieved his dream life, told reporters Tuesday he regrets wasting money on a college education. �What�s the point of going $30,000 in debt if my starting annual salary out of college is only going to be $60,000 per year?� said Michaelson, who, despite aspiring to be a high-powered CEO, simply has a steady position as an operations manager at a successful Midtown real estate firm. �I studied my ass off majoring in computer science and I�ve been in the workforce for 18 months, but here I am now, a 24-year-old without a beautiful family, a second home, multiple sports cars, or an issue of GQ with my face on the cover. The whole thing�s such a racket.� Michaelson added that all he had to show for his education was a worthless piece of paper and a luxurious studio apartment in the East Village."
"Entering her examination room to find a woman describing in detail how she had once spent several hours coughing up blood, general practitioner Anika Korman described her state of mind as �completely weirded out� Monday when patient Catherine Moritz evidently decided to provide every lurid detail of her medical history. �I had barely walked through the door before she started describing how she contracted something she called �chicken skin� when she was 9 years old. Jesus, lady, I�m practically a stranger,� said Korman of Moritz, who left nothing to the imagination in her graphic recounting of her every encounter with swimmer�s ear, UTIs, and yeast infections. �Totally and completely unprompted, she immediately disclosed her entire sexual history�right down to the names of her partners and the STIs she�s contracted. I�m like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey now, do I look like your best friend? You don�t just tell someone you had really bad diarrhea a couple weeks ago, or even that you had a nasty abscess in your ear in late 2012. I mean, do I know you? Slow down, lady, damn.� At press time, Korman was trying to exit the examination room as Moritz, having exhausted her own medical history, began recounting that of her 65-year-old mother."
"Expressing disbelief at her romantic partner�s dramatic behavioral shift, local woman Emily Kittleson, 30, told reporters Friday that she had not expected her boyfriend�s attempts to recognize and curtail toxic masculinity would eventually turn him into a �weepy little pansy.� �Christ, I know the dope is trying to be conscious of the effects of his words and actions and to be more open and honest with his emotions, but there�s got to be a limit,� said Kittleson of her boyfriend Shane Magnusen, 31, whose efforts to reject toxic masculinity have begun to irritate her as she claims he has evolved into �a fragile fucking flower about everything� in recent weeks. �Of course I�m happy for social progress and all, but this ineffectual shit is not what I signed up for. Instead of suppressing his emotions about major issues in his life, he cries at sad commercials. Our fights used to be him screaming at me for a few minutes and that was it, not great but not terrible. Then last night, we get into an argument that somehow turns into me nodding and making comforting noises while he talks about his strained relationship with his dad until well after midnight. Like, come on, I don�t have time to indulge this self-centered crap.� Kittleson was also compelled to interrupt her statements twice, groaning and rolling her eyes while responding to text messages from Shane regarding their couples� therapy appointments later that week."
"Calling Euphornica the only model he trusts with his raw-dogging needs, Pleasure Cove employee Jason Kempner told customers Rick Cantor and Jennifer Wilson Thursday that this, here, is the fuck harness he has at home. �This bad boy is the best one we�ve got. Sure, it costs a little more than the Commando, but you couldn�t ask for a more durable fuck harness or a better long-term investment�I�ve had one in my bedroom for a decade and it hasn�t cinched my balls or ass hairs once,� said Kempner, adding that the sex swing was easy to mount, stain resistant, and the model that he personally recommends to friends and gifts to family members for Christmas. �Those straps are really high-quality, no chaffing at all. I got a ton of mileage out of this one and it can hold 400 pounds for sure. Trust me, I set my brother-in-law up with this puppy just last week and he�s constantly raving about it.� At press time, Kempner had convinced the couple to take sex swing for a quick test fuck."
"Wondering what kind of honor a company bestows upon a part-time clerical employee, the family of local woman Maureen Tavlin, 51, reported Wednesday there was simply no way of knowing whether the vague award their mother received at work was a big deal or what, exactly. �She got this little plate that looks kind of like a trophy and might be important, I suppose, but the inscription just says �For your contributions,� which could mean anything, really,� said son Brian Tavlin of the award presented to his mother at �some sort of banquet� that sounded like it might�ve been kind of fancy, but also could have been just a regular lunch. �Maybe everyone at the company gets an award? Then again, she said everyone clapped for her, which makes it seem like more of a special thing. I�ve always gotten the impression she doesn�t really care that much about her job, though, so who knows? It�s nice she got something, I guess.� At press time, Maureen Tavlin was reportedly putting the award up on her mantlepiece, which sources said could be a sign she was proud of it or could just mean she didn�t know what else to do with it"
"Deeming her entire apartment an �accident waiting to happen,� local woman Jeanine Kratz, 29, told reporters Wednesday that she was rushing to hide any fragile objects and cover up sharp corners on tables before her boyfriend came over. �I really have to clean this place up as much as possible, because Chuck puts everything in his mouth and I worry he�ll swallow something and then I�m going to end up taking him to the emergency room,� said Kratz as she scrambled to remove any plastic bags the 32-year-old could suffocate on, place a lighter on a higher shelf, and hide any pill bottles that he could somehow �get his grubby little hands on.� �It�s honestly amazing what he�ll get into, whether he�s climbing onto my countertops, pushing over my television, or sticking his fingers into outlets when I�m not looking. Last time, he fell straight through my glass table�I thought he was going to die. And that�s not even counting the time he pissed all over the carpet.� At press time, Kratz excused herself to the other room after hearing a thud, followed by a loud wail and her boyfriend crying."
"Complaining about the 25-year-old�s superficial choice deviating from society�s standard relationship terminology, witnesses confirmed Wednesday that pretentious woman Louisa Owens chose to continually refer to her slam piece as her �partner.� �Oh, please�Jack�s your �partner� now? Give me a break. Stop trying to sound so woke and sophisticated and just call him your boy toy like the rest of us,� said annoyed bystander Erin Friesen, rolling her eyes as she noted Owens�s refusal to �get down off her high horse� and just refer to her live-in fuck puppet using the normal, commonly accepted terms. �When you first started dating, you said you were so excited to officially call him your bang buddy, and now he�s suddenly your �partner?� Alright, Ms. Gender Studies. What makes your relationship so goddamn important?� Friesen went on to wonder whether, if the couple got married, they would still refer to each other as �partner� or as their fucking nag."
"Noting the wide variety of nonperishable items lining the shelves, furloughed government employee Sheena Enders, 38, confirmed Wednesday she was using some of the time off from her job with the U.S. Census Bureau to visit the local food pantry she had heard so much about. �I�ve driven past this place before, but this is the first time I�ve ever had the chance to try it,� said Enders, who has yet to receive a paycheck in 2019, adding that with her office closed she would have plenty of time to wait if there was a line to get in. �My friends from work keep suggesting I check it out. I guess some of them went there over the holidays. They warned me there might be a bit of a wait, but said there�s a good selection of items to choose from�pasta, canned soup, rice�even stuff I�ve never tried before, like powdered milk. I hope it lives up to the hype.� At press time, sources reported the gas to Enders� apartment had been cut off and she had decided to treat herself to a day at the local emergency warming center."
"Dreading the day new technologies would emerge to render his craft obsolete, Vince Callahan, an autoworker crouched inside a robotic welding arm, told reporters Tuesday that he was terrified a robot would eventually take his job. �This is all I know how to do. If they ever make a robot that can do this job, I�m finished,� said Callahan, adding that, with 20 years of experience in the ultra-specific field and only a trade school degree, he would be unlikely to find another job in the event of being replaced by an automated machine. �Huddled here in the control center of a welding arm all day and performing the same identical task 2,000 times in a row isn�t exactly the easiest job in the world, but I�ve got a family to feed. I hope the powers that be understand that this job takes the type of heart and passion only a human can provide.� Callahan also expressed fears that robots would one day replace his wife�s job handing out soft drinks from inside a vending machine."
"Stressing that the furniture would be perfect for hosting guests, your mom wanted to know Tuesday whether you could use Grandma�s antique, 12-person dining room table in your studio apartment. �If you want it, we can haul it over the next time I have a doctor�s appointment in the city,� your mother said, explaining that the table didn�t always have to seat 12 people as there were two leaves that could expand its capacity to 18. �We�re just cleaning out her basement and thought this might work well if you�re having a dinner party. Believe me, those 12 chairs will definitely come in handy the next time some unexpected guests stop by for game night. There�s also a matching china hutch where you can keep all of the antique crystal centerpieces. So, when can you come and take a look?� At press time, your mom warned that the table weighed over 500 pounds, but confirmed that your dad was available next weekend to help carry it up your eight-story walkup."
"Staring wide-eyed at the table full of unopened presents being largely ignored by guests, local man Rick Joseph reportedly watched helplessly Friday as the White Elephant exchange completely devolved into friends just chatting and having a nice time. �Christ, it should have been my turn to pick a gift over an hour ago, but we keep getting derailed by everyone blabbing on and on about what they�re doing for fucking Christmas,� said Joseph, who was forced to listen to friends engaged in pleasant conversations about family traditions, favorite holiday recipes, and beloved childhood memories of the festive season. �Ugh, this is a goddamn disaster. These chumps should be strategizing about which person they�re going to screw over to get the best present, but instead they�re wasting this time trying to bond. No one is even fighting. This is the last time I invite people over for a holiday party.� Joseph confirmed that the evening turned into an utter nightmare after his friends began singing their favorite Christmas carols."
"Detailing the extensive backstories of the wall hangings and how he came to acquire them, local man Richard Minhas was methodically explaining Thursday the origin of every poster hanging in his apartment. �This one over here is a print of a Japanese woodblock I got from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and then the one right next to it is a vintage Tylenol advertisement I picked up at a garage sale,� said Minhas, ushering his guest around the 750-square-foot space, stopping by the placards, which included an old-timey map of Arizona and a reproduction of a 1977 Fleetwood Mac tour poster, to elucidate their content as well as his personal connection to the pieces. �I really like this French movie The Wages Of Fear, so I placed it next to this other poster for Bicycle Thieves, since they�re both movies. As for these ones in the kitchen, this is a taxonomic chart cataloguing a bunch of varieties of mushrooms, this one is the same thing but with spices, this one is a diagram of a cow showing all the cuts of beef, and then this is an old sign advertising fresh tomatoes I got at a farmers market.� After he finished explaining all the posters, Minhas reportedly expounded on every keepsake on his bookshelf.�"
"Sighing in exasperation and repeatedly checking the clock as he completed a number of menial tasks, area man Alan Stover confirmed Wednesday he had spent a long day at work waiting until he could finally go home and be lonely. �It�s so annoying having to be here in the office doing all this tedious paperwork when I could be sitting there all alone in my empty apartment,� said Stover, telling reporters he was �counting down the minutes� until he could at long last go home, stretch out on the sofa, and just feel hollow inside for the rest of the evening. �By the time I get out of the afternoon meeting and finish all these spreadsheets, I�ll be lucky if I can still putter around my apartment, eat leftover takeout in front of the microwave, vacantly scroll through Netflix, blearily mutter �time for bed� to myself, and fall asleep before I have to start the whole thing over again tomorrow. God, it feels like five o�clock will never come.� At press time, Stover was reportedly frustrated after his evening plans were ruined by a text inviting him to a bar for a friend�s birthday."
"Saying that he had �a really good feeling about today,� excited firefighter Pat Morales, 37, took the first opportunity he had on his Wednesday shift to check his fire station�s drop-off bin for any unwanted babies that may have come in while the crew was away. �Every time I come to work, I try to be the first one to the bin to check for babies�it�s really the best part of my day,� a grinning Morales told reporters as he gleefully unlocked the climate-controlled box outside of Saint Paul Fire Station 19 and felt around the padded interior, being careful to check to see if any infants were clogging the chute or had perhaps become stuck in the slot. �It just makes you feel special when you come back from a hard day of fighting fires and there�s a fresh baby warming up in the drop box. Even if we�ve only been out for an hour, I always check the bin when we get back. You never know!� According to his coworkers, Morales is always the first to volunteer every year to decorate the newly donated babies for the holidays."
"Declaring his willingness to put the whole phase of his life behind him once and for all, 28-year-old man Neil Donovan confirmed Tuesday that he had finally found it in himself to forgive himself for a terrible mistake he made two seconds ago. �This has been an albatross around my neck for what sometimes seems like several seconds, but I think it�s time that I finally accept myself for what I�ve grown into and move on,� said Donovan, adding that he was looking forward to starting his life�s next chapter unencumbered by the relentless guilt and self-loathing that consumed every waking moment of his past two seconds. �Honestly, letting go lifted a huge weight from my shoulders. It took real soul searching, painful admissions about who I really was back then, and, ultimately, personal growth and maturation for me to realize that I can�t keep living in my immediate past. Eventually, I was granted a fresh perspective, and I came to accept that there will be a time, perhaps 10 seconds from now, when I won�t even remember that any of this happened.� Donovan also admitted he still does not understand how his wife could bear the emotional strain of living with grudges stemming from something he did over 14 seconds ago."
"Admitting that he thought he would have moved on by now, 28-year-old marketing analyst Garrett Moore reportedly grew wistful and teary-eyed Monday while revealing that everything still reminded him of Her. �Even the breeze in the park reminds of the cool rush of air conditioning I felt in the theater that night when I first saw Her,� said Moore, adding that everything from the smell of buttered popcorn to the sweet taste of raspberry iced tea brought back torrents of vivid memories that could always be traced back to Her. �When I close my eyes, I can picture Her so clearly. Any time I hear that Kim Deal song �Are You Mine?� I recall those few fleeting hours we spent together in the summer of 2013. I�ve rarely seen Her since I left the theater that night. About a year ago, I saw Her across the room at a party, but didn�t have the courage to approach. Maybe it�s for the best. Either way, I�ll always cherish what we had back then.� At press time, Moore confirmed that the $13.29 he paid for that magical night with Her was the best money he�d ever spent."
"Struggling to explain her positive emotional state, area woman Erin Kinney reportedly spent Monday wondering why she was suddenly happy despite not having purchased anything recently. �Huh, that�s weird. Why do I feel so content right now? I don�t think I splurged on anything today, but maybe I just forgot,� said Kinney, who then proceeded to scroll back through her Amazon order history to double check if she had purchased anything that had momentarily slipped her mind. �I swear I must have bought, like, a new sweater, a fancy candle, or some expensive Korean face masks to make myself this cheerful and energized, but I looked at my credit card statement and I apparently I didn�t buy a single thing�not even groceries. Did I go to Target recently? I don�t have any memory of going shopping, but why else would I feel so good?� At press time, Kinney told reporters that she had become so flustered by the whole situation that she had no choice but to run out to a local drug store and buy herself a little pick-me-up"
"Claiming past experiences taught him to be prepared for sudden displays of vitality, mortician Radiston Nikolov, 38, told reporters Thursday that he always keeps a hammer beside his mortuary table in case one of his embalming subjects comes back to life. �I just like knowing this baby�s within reach in the event we get the odd twitcher or moaner. Sure, it might make some families uncomfortable, but better safe than sorry,� said Nikolov, who over the course of his career has relied on a series of bludgeons from baseball bats to golf clubs to provide much-needed peace of mind during his long, solitary night shifts. �Granted, I�ve only had to use it a couple times over the years, but like my father always said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.� Nikolov is currently involved in a legal dispute with a local widower who is seeking half a million dollars in damages and an explanation as to why his wife�s mortal remains had been pummeled to bits in her coffin."
"Saying that the reduction in her daily caffeine intake had markedly improved her overall mood and outlook, sales associate Sherri Packer, 32, said Monday that she has made notable progress weaning herself off coffee by switching to Long Island iced tea. �I didn�t realize how dependent on my Starbucks I had become, but I can easily drink two or three of these iced teas and still not get as much caffeine as my usual drink,� said Packer, noting that she was calmer, more easygoing, laughed more often, and experienced far fewer jitters after making the simple switch to a mixture of gin, vodka, rum, triple sec, tequila, sour mix, and a splash of cola. �I can mix it up in the morning and bring it to work in my thermos, so I don�t have to deal with long lines at the coffee shop. It�s a great little pick-me-up. Sure, there�s still caffeine in the cola, but it�s just enough to help keep the cravings away. I only wish I had made the switch sooner.� Packer claims the small change in her routine has decreased the amount of time she used to spend tossing and turning before falling asleep at night, and that her drive to work was both much faster and less stressful."
"Claiming that the footwear in question would go nicely with a lot of things in your wardrobe, your mother sent you a blurry and indistinct photo of her home computer screen Friday ostensibly displaying a pair of boots you might like. �I was looking at the internet and thought of you when I saw these on the Amazon�s website. Don�t they look comfy?� read the text message from your mom that accompanied a pixelated cell phone image of boots of an indecipherable style and color alongside several open tabs and a folder on the desktop titled �Family Pics 2014.� �I know you mentioned last spring you were looking for some new boots, and these look just like that pair of boots you wore when I came to visit you last year. It looks like they have your size, too.� At press time, mom was sending you a photo of the URL so you could order them when you got home."
"Claiming that one would need a degree from Harvard just to find the front desk, Illinois father of three Tom Rutledge confirmed Friday that the Holiday Inn Express in Janesville, WI was a goddamn maze. �I don�t get why they designed it like this,� said 52-year-old Rutledge of the four-story, mid-priced accomodations. �Where the hell is the elevator? It took me five minutes just to find the goddamn vending machine. And for Christ�s sake, why are the ice machines only on every other floor? I swear this place is like one of [Rutledge�s 15-year-old son] Evan�s crazy posters with the stairs going everywhere. I mean, for 115 bucks a night, you�d think you�d get decent signage, at least.� Rutledge�s family members said he was last seen wearing swim trunks wandering through a dimly lit conference room carrying an unused towel."
"In what authorities hope serves as a warning to any domesticated animal who places medical patients at risk, Kuma, 3, a German shepherd who successfully detected cancer in his owner, was put down Thursday for practicing medicine without a license. �Although in this particular case the animal�s actions did save a life, this dog is not only in blatant violation of medical standards but has been conducting a de facto illegal medical practice, which we cannot condone,� Judge Marlena Peters said during the dog�s sentencing, clarifying that Kuma�s clear lack of medical education, certification, or experience posed a potential danger to those around him, and that his masquerade as a medical professional was deeply insulting to licensed doctors and nurses everywhere. �The fact that this dog�s diagnosis happened to be correct in this isolated case does not absolve him of the crime of fraudulent practice. We must eradicate any and all dogs who practice medicine illegally in order to ensure standards within the medical community are maintained.� Judge Peters is currently engaged in the sentencing of a cat convicted of obstruction of justice for repeatedly interfering with the investigation into its owner�s homicide."
"Admitting that she had never suspected anything dubious until recently hearing the details of her significant other�s past, local woman Debra Haas told reporters Thursday that she found it worrying that all of her new boyfriend�s previous relationships ended in breakups. �I could see if only one or two had finished like that, but all of them ending the same way is just a huge red flag,� said Haas, adding that had she known that he had broken up with every single one of his girlfriends, she might have reconsidered becoming intimate with him at all. �I know it�s unfair to judge Stephen by what happened with the other women in his life, but the common denominator in all these failed romances is him. I just wish we had talked about this before we started dating so I could have made a more informed choice about whether to get involved with him or not.� Haas later added that all her doubts were put to ease when she found out that her boyfriend had one very successful, 10-year marriage that he was still currently in."
"Relying completely on the acclaimed poet�s platitudes on life, love, and loss, anxiety-ridden wedding participant Kelsey Guzman based the majority of her maid of honor speech this week on random Maya Angelou quotes strung together on extremely thin pretenses. �I thought Kels would be okay when she opened the speech with a workmanlike �As the great Maya Angelou once said�� but pretty soon it became obvious she had no idea what she was doing,� said bridesmaid Rachael Klein, who watched with the rest of the guests in mounting discomfort as Guzman clumsily illustrated her friendship with the bride by reading several entirely unrelated and nonsequential lines of �On the Pulse of Morning.� �Just when you think she�s going to say something nice and genuine about Jessica, she panics and dives right back into Angelou. In fact, if you didn�t know the bride at all, you�d be really impressed with the resilience and courage she displayed while growing up black in the Depression-era south. Oh, God, did she just say �Still, like dust, Jessica�s love for Matthew rises?� Yikes.� Guzman then concluded her speech with yet another Maya Angelou quote, which she wrongfully attributed to Toni Morrison."
"Questioning what had become of common decency, passengers aboard a Brooklyn-bound F train expressed feelings of disgust Tuesday in regard to a pervert who wouldn�t stop staring at the masturbator in their subway car. �My God, this sicko�s not even making any attempt to hide it�he�s just openly leering at that man over in the corner who�s masturbating,� said subway passenger James Ellis Vogt of the depraved individual who, given his clear preoccupation with the public masturbator, was apparently deriving some sort of vile gratification from watching the complete stranger open his pants and begin vigorously rubbing his penis. �What�s worse is that this pervert keeps exchanging glances with everyone around him as if he wants to make sure we, too, see the person exposing himself and trying to bring himself to orgasm. Look, pal, maybe ogling a man as he rubs one out on a crowded train is what does it for you, but we don�t want anything to do with your disgusting little fantasy, okay?� At press time, sources confirmed transit police had escorted the pervert off the train and were asking the masturbator if he would like to file a formal complaint."
"Uploading almost a gigabyte of image files to her various social media accounts, nursing assistant Katherine Rohrbach, 26, took the precaution of posting several of her favorite photos of herself online Tuesday just in case she dies in a mass shooting. �Should I ever be cut down by a deranged gunman while shopping or going to the movies or dancing at a bar, I want to make sure the first photos of me the media can find are nice ones where I�m having a good hair day and you can see my face clearly,� said Rohrbach, scrolling through her phone camera�s album and selecting photos she believed to be tasteful and which showcased her personality. �I don�t want my friends and loved ones to learn about my violent firearms-related death by seeing a bad selfie on the news, or maybe a snap where I�m drunk at a bar. Also, there are high school photos of me up now that I should probably just delete.� At press time, Rohrbach�s friends and family were protesting CNN�s use of a photo of Rohrbach standing next to a more attractive friend after both were shot to death at a birthday party."
"Describing the majority of attendees as �acquaintances at best,� birthday celebrant Megan Randall stated publicly Tuesday that a surprise birthday party organized by her boyfriend, Kevin Collins, displayed a less-than-minimal familiarity with her social circle. �I frankly haven�t spoken to some of these people in years,� said Randall, 29, disclosing that roughly a third of the revelers who burst out of her darkened kitchen upon her return from work appeared to have been members of her boyfriend�s flag football team. �I went to college with Beth, but that was 10 years ago and we really didn�t even hang out then. The vibe was super weird because nobody seemed to know anybody else. What was Kevin thinking? There�s a guy here I dumped in high school. And he completely left out Sophia, my best friend. Honestly, it�s like he saw some pictures and heard some stories from my college days and just invited those people, which is strange since he�s heard me talk a ton of shit about them.� An explanation for the incident is not expected to be immediately forthcoming, as Randall temporarily suspended communication with her boyfriend the moment her intercom was buzzed by a group of former coworkers brandishing a bottle of Fireball."
"Expressing disappointment at the evident lack of concern for their failed relationship, divorced parents Tim Foster and Eva Ferguson admitted Thursday to being �a little hurt� that the recently completed Christmas list submitted by their daughter Kayla, 8, included no heartfelt but ultimately unrealistic wishes that they might reconcile their differences and get back together as a family once more. �Kayla wants Santa to bring her a new boogie board and a Nintendo Switch�the Nintendo gets five exclamation points�but there�s no mention of her mommy and daddy falling back in love, which I�ve got to admit stings a little,� said Eva Ferguson, adding that, despite her absolute certainty regarding her fundamental incompatibility with her ex-husband, it would be an affirmation of their parenting skills if her daughter begged Santa for a Christmas miracle to bring them together under one roof again. �I�m glad she�s taking the divorce in stride, I guess, but we only just separated back in July. It seemed like she only wanted us to get back together for a couple weeks before completely moving on. We never would, not in a million years, but I sort of wish she wanted it more than she wants a Lego pirate ship.� Ferguson also noted that Kayla had selfishly failed to ask Santa for her recently deceased grandmother to come back to life."
"In what was interpreted as a final attempt to foster scientific curiosity in high school juniors, James A. Garfield Memorial High School chemistry teacher Gary Holbrook encouraged his students Monday to fuck around with Bunsen burners in a last-ditch effort to prove that science is cool. �As you can see by my demonstration, you can pour any chemicals you�d like into your round-bottomed flask�sulfuric acid, nitrogen, mercury�and just crank up the heat,� said Holbrook, evidently hoping to instill an appetite for science in his students by allowing them to just open cupboards in the lab and mix up whichever chemicals seemed the coolest to them. �Oh, also�if you�re curious about relative specific heats of common household materials versus those of organic tissues, you and your lab partner can stick a paperclip over the flame, and take turns branding each other. Really get that thing glowing hot. As far as we know, this is how all great chemists discovered their passion for lab work.� Holbrook declared his approach a qualified success after his students became sufficiently interested in science to ignite a hydrogen-filled balloon, burning down the school laboratory."
"Emphasizing that his thoughts were always and only for his fellow motorists, local parallel parker Ed Billings admitted Monday that he strives to leave just enough room between the cars ahead of or behind his own so that other drivers are eventually infuriated into simply giving up after a few abortive parking attempts. �All right, this looks like exactly enough space for the driver of a midsized sedan or small SUV to spend about 10 minutes giving it their best shot while other drivers honk at them before they finally get unnerved or annoyed and drive away,� said Billings, 39, expertly evaluating the carefully calculated space between his 2005 Honda CR-V and the crossover SUV seven-eighths of a car length in front of him. �I want to leave just enough distance for a car of average size to struggle with taking a stab at several different angles of approach and getting exasperatingly close to wedging themselves into this spot before they finally just yell �Fuck it� a few times and pound on their steering wheels before calling it quits. It�s just a little thing I do for my fellow drivers. I also want to make sure I leave exactly the right space so that the person in front of me has to hit my front bumper while trying to back out.� At press time, Billings was struggling to suppress his rage and frustration as the driver of a 2017 Smart Fortwo simply breezed into the undersized parking spot in a single attempt."
"Expressing optimism and excitement for what her romantic future might hold, local woman Fiona Dixon reportedly wondered Monday if the man she just went on a date with might finally be the one she�ll sleep with for a few weeks before losing interest. �I know we just met, but I�m feeling such a strong connection with Brian that I could definitely see us getting together again for mediocre sex and sort of just doing that for about a month until I get bored,� said Dixon, detailing her date�s passable yet unintimidating looks and sense of humor that was funny enough to be entertaining but not smart enough to be engaging. �He has everything I�ve ever dreamed of�a decent body, medium intelligence, and the right amount of interests in common to keep me occupied for a little while before I realize how incompatible we are, maybe hook up a couple more times, and then move on. Mark my words: One day, I�m going to ditch this man for something better and then repeat the cycle.� At press time, Dixon had giddily saved her companion�s mobile number into her phone contacts as �Future Mr. Wrong.�"
"Noting your undergraduate minor in data systems, a qualification which he claims makes you uniquely suited for the job, a corporate recruiter happened to notice your background in computer science and thought you might be interested in working part-time at a Kohl�s department store in Sioux City, IA, retail sector sources confirmed Friday. �Hello, my name is Michael Leahy, and I wanted to touch base with you regarding an exciting retail employment opportunity in the greater northwestern Iowa area,� the email sent to your LinkedIn account read in part, adding that your strong coding skills made you an ideal fit for the 20-hour-per-week position, which also entails stocking merchandise, working the register, and one dedicated shift a week greeting customers at the door. �For bright, young college graduates such as yourself, especially given your experience with Java and C++, the Kohl�s in Lakeport County Shopping Center is the perfect place to start a career. Also, your current job in software marketing, plus the 2013 semester abroad you spent studying in Argentina, demonstrate you are a great fit for our team-based work culture!� Although the email was promptly sent straight to spam, the recruiter proceeded to call you multiple times, claiming that if you played your cards right, this could one day turn into a full-time position."
"Concerned about the welfare of the �cold and kind of lonely-looking� submissive chained to a street sign outside of a coffee shop, sympathetic passersby discussed the ethics Friday of leaving one�s gimp tied to a pole while one buys a latte. �It�s really cold out here, especially with this wind, and the poor little painslut�s wearing rhinestone-studded leather chaps,� said passerby Lee Schroeder of the disoriented masochist whose neglectful master had emerged from the shop only once in a two-hour period to perfunctorily whip him and piss in his mouth. �Should I go over and see if he�s okay, maybe fist him a little? I considered cock-and-ball torturing him earlier, but you never know if these little guys are gonna bite. God, my heart always breaks when I see a fucktoy all by himself, barking �Spank me, Daddy!� over and over while his dom is inside wearing noise-cancelling headphones.� Observers were later able to breathe a sigh of relief as the gimp�s owner came out, untied him, and ran a Wartenberg pinwheel over his nipples."
"Decrying the contraceptive device as an uncomfortable inconvenience, local man Michael Franklin revealed Thursday that he hates having to wear condoms all day every day. �It just doesn�t feel natural, and I barely get any sensation when I�m going about my day,� said Franklin, complaining that the latex contraceptive was too tight and hurt his penis while attempting to finish various tasks at home and work. �I just don�t like to feel anything between me and the fabric of my boxers, and that latex smell is kind of gross to deal with 24/7. But I want to be safe and responsible, so I just put up with it. At least I know I�m protected when I�m walking down the street or am at the office.� At press time, an embarrassed Franklin was apologizing and asking his coworkers to wait �just a second� after his condom fell off and slid down his pant leg during a presentation."
"Entertaining dozens of options in her search for the perfect birthday gift, local 27-year-old Alison Levine reportedly spent Friday toying with getting her sister something nice they could do together before settling on a candle. �At first I thought I�d get her a gift certificate so we could bond at a pottery class or something, but then I saw this lavender-scented candle, and I�m pretty sure she likes candles,� said Levine, who had immediately dropped plans to buy craft supplies to make a scrapbook with her sister after spotting the $28 glass jar candle at Anthropologie. �Obviously, it would�ve been cool to get in some quality time with Mary at a spa or pedicure. On the other hand, this candle was on sale, and who can�t use a candle?� At press time, Levine was playing with the possibility of suggesting that she and her sister could take turns lighting the candle and blowing it out."
"Unanimously insisting that the 17 separate tasks would only take a moment and be no trouble at all, each and every member of the Blake family present for Thanksgiving dinner Thursday reportedly undertook a chore in order to get some time away from the rest of their family. �Here, now, I can take the trash out. I really don�t mind, it�s no trouble, please don�t get up,� said 54-year-old family patriarch Frank Blake, volunteering for a task that would take him outside for a six- to eight-minute break from his from his wife and adult children, who had in turn spent the last five hours busying themselves with various tasks in order to avoid interacting with one another on the family-centric holiday. �After I set the cans by the curb, why don�t I just, you know, run down to the basement and grab the centerpieces. I can even get the extra folding chairs [and linger there for as long as I can so I don�t have to spend time with you guys] while I�m down there. You guys just enjoy your holiday.� At press time, the entire Blake family was concocting excuses to run to the store in separate cars to prevent any chances of having to make conversation."
"Emphasizing the importance of savoring each moment with her family while she still can, 93-year-old grandmother Regina Silver expressed fears Thursday that this Thanksgiving might be the last time she would see Derek Silver, 25, her notorious fuck-up grandson, before his death. �That boy just seems to get worse and worse every time I see him,� said Silver, noting that her grandson appeared to be mentally unsteady and in poor health from years of hard partying and was still showing the effects of a July fall off the garage roof while attempting to film a viral video with his friends. �He doesn�t drive anymore since his license got taken away for his third DUI, so I don�t get to see him as much. But even though the stories are always kind of sad, I want to be sure to spend some time hearing about his life while he�s still with us. I just want to appreciate him for the failure he is while he�s still alive.� At press time, Silver was patiently struggling to follow along with her grandson�s incoherent and codeine-influenced stories of the time he got kicked out of junior college."
"Unable to escape the crowded procession, local man Alex Boutros was pissed Thursday after becoming trapped in the Macy�s Day Parade while he was out walking his giant Pikachu balloon. �Goddammit, this is just my fucking luck,� said Boutros, who was stuck between the Rockettes and the �Snoopy�s Doghouse� float, adding that he was just planning on taking a quick stroll to walk his Pok�mon-themed balloon and grab some coffee but ended up getting swept up in a high school marching band while�attempting to cross Seventh Ave. �I tried to get out, but the crowd just started screaming and pushed me in line. Now I�m, like, 30 blocks from where I�m supposed to be, and all this commotion is really freaking out my Pikachu.� At press time, a frustrated Boutros was frantically stuffing his Pikachu balloon into a cab."
"Saying that �the universe works in mysterious ways,� local woman Rebecca Ellis claimed Monday to be amazed at how she found the perfect partner just when she was getting desperate enough to accept anything. �Who would have thought I�d find the most perfect guy for me at almost the same instant I lowered my standards to a level I�d once have found unthinkable? I mean, what are the odds?� said Ellis, 28, marvelling at the timing involved in meeting her soulmate mere days after resolving not to spend another winter alone. �There I was, unimaginably lonely and quickly running out of options in this backward town, when suddenly Kevin barges through that door and fills the recently created Kevin-shaped void in my heart.� At press time, Ellis was overwhelmed with gratitude upon landing her dream job mere weeks after lowering her salary requirements and to giving up hope of getting decent health benefits."
"Heralding the 2,200-year-old fired-clay container as a priceless addition to one of the world�s largest collections of same, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a press conference Friday to announce the acquisition of yet another vase. �We�re more than thrilled to add one more intricately designed vase from either late Greek or early Roman times. Could be Phoenician, really. We�ll have to check. At any rate, it shares many of the same basic characteristics as other vases in our possession, distinguishing itself through slight differences that you no doubt will be easily able to discern,� said museum director and CEO Daniel Weiss, noting that the ceramic piece would be placed on display in the passageway between the �Interminable and Labyrinthian Galleries of Asian Art� and �Stacks and Stacks of Musical Instruments� wings. �We look forward to our visitors spending 10 or 12 seconds blinking at this excellent example of a vase, and perhaps even reading its placard in the hope of learning something uniquely interesting about it, but most likely it will simply read �vase� and list a general time period for its creation.� The Met also took the opportunity to announce the acquisition of a bunch more old coins."
"Pausing very briefly to reflect joyfully on her new role amid the day�s flurry of activity, new parent Suzanne Knott declared �becoming a mother has been the most thrilling experience of my life� Friday while fleeing the hospital with the baby she abducted mere moments before. �The very first moment I held this tiny human in my arms, I knew my entire world had changed forever,� said Knott, clutching the sleeping newborn close to her chest as she cut through the natal ICU to avoid pursuit, knocking over carts and incubators behind her to deter the nurses and security guards attempting to intercept her. �When her big, brown eyes met mine, I knew I would do anything for her, including knocking out her attending physician, stealing his coat, sneaking into the nursery, scooping her out of her crib, and running to the parking garage. I know, I know, everyone says motherhood changes a person, but until I finally clutched her close to my chest, I didn�t realize how true it was. And now this little one�s all mine.� Knott has yet to decide on a name, but was strongly leaning towards �Autumn� after hiding overnight with her baby in a pile of leaves."
"Confessing that her grief was somewhat moderated by seeing events play out exactly as she had warned, local mother Deborah Klein said Thursday she felt somewhat vindicated upon learning that her teenage daughter Rachel, after staying out later than parental rules allowed, had been murdered. �Sure, Rachel�s violent murder is not at all my desired outcome, but if I�m honest, it feels good to say �I told you so,� even if it�s just to the bedroom she�ll never come home to again,� said Klein, adding that her daughter would often �pooh-pooh� repeated warnings that nothing good ever happens after midnight and disregarded entreaties to call in often with her location. �I would, of course, do anything in this world to get my sweet baby girl back, but it�s also nice to know I wasn�t being insane or unreasonable or mean, as some young people have been known to say, when I told her that we have curfews for a reason. Yes, this major tragedy will shatter me and I�ll never be whole again, but sometimes kids have to learn the hard way.� Klein later added that she intends to mention Rachel daily as a warning to her surviving children."
"Appalled by the blatant lack of hygiene from someone they share a workspace with, employees at Avignon Public Relations were reportedly horrified Thursday that their disgusting coworker Mark Sharpe had barely bothered to wash his ass before leaving the restroom. �That�s so gross�I don�t know what he�s thinking,� said sales associate Remy O�Connor, noting that Sharpe had done little more than sprinkle some lukewarm water on his ass and barely dry off his cheeks with a paper towel before returning to his desk. �It�s so unsanitary. He didn�t use soap at all, and I also got the sense that if I hadn�t been in the bathroom at the same time as him, he wouldn�t have cleaned his ass at all.� O�Connor noted that he would be sure to use plenty of Purell on his own ass if he came in contact with Sharpe."
"Stressing the difficulty of moving forward in a particularly trying stage of the mourning process, local widow Simone Irving told reporters Thursday that she still couldn�t bring herself to get rid of her late husband�s corpse. �I know it sounds silly, but it�s the last thing I have of him,� said Irving, explaining that despite the urgings of friends, family members, and grief counselors, she had yet to dispose of her husband�s decaying body for over a year after his passing. �Everyone keeps telling me it�s time to move on with my life, but it�s hard. I mean, Geoff�s corpse still smells just like him. Sometimes, after a hard day, I�ll still curl up in bed with it. I know it may not seem healthy, but I just can�t seem to part with it.� At press time, Irving was packing up her deceased husband�s old body in a garbage bag to store in the attic."
"Noting that the contemporary romantic vibe was totally different than the one he experienced in the late Clinton era, recently divorced advertising copywriter Richard Hamlin, 40, admitted Wednesday that he was struggling to navigate the college dating scene. �It�s not easy jumping back into the acton, especially when you have all these new apps to learn,� said Hamlin, remarking that everything from the music to the entire composition of Main Street had completely changed in the decades since he was dating his ex-wife. �Sometimes, I even find myself thinking that I have nothing in common with these 19-year-olds. When I show up at the bar, nobody seems to want to talk to me. It used to come so naturally, but now, when I ask someone about their major, they become uncomfortable and sort of melt away the first chance they get. I never thought I would say this, but I�m definitely considering joining a frat.� A dejected Hamlin later reported negative results from an attempt to �up his game� by spending $7 to load the jukebox with 45 straight minutes of Spin Doctors."
"Saying he was unwilling to compromise his ideals by dressing in lesser-quality garb, naked man Jon Russo confirmed Wednesday that he was refusing to let unworthy attire touch his body while he awaits the launch of new Onionstore merchandise. �My body is a temple and deserves to be draped in finery of a level only the Onion store can provide,� said the nude Russo, scrolling through the site�s collection of men�s T-shirts impeccably screen-printed by one of China�s most deluxe bulk T-shirt suppliers. �For my torso, only a comfort-fit sweatshirt emblazoned with the Onion logo will do. Until I receive my order, just a few standard shipping days from now, my skin will remain bare and untainted by inferior branded clothing.� At press time, a visibly sunburned Russo was attempting to rehydrate by drinking from his favorite Onioncoffee mug."
"Citing her can-do spirit, belief in her own talents, and considerable trust fund, aspiring screenwriter and playwright Dasha Rothwell confirmed Monday that she was confident she had the safety net it would take to achieve her dreams. �I truly feel I have what it takes to pursue my creative and personal goals here in a big city. Even if it means pounding the pavement in my Lexus hybrid, only dining out five or six times a week, and forking out that much more for rent each month, I�ll just buckle down, grit my teeth, and ask my parents for the extra cash,� said Rothwell, 24, stressing that she�s not afraid of failure or having to start back at square one, as she would suffer no financial or material repercussions whatsoever in doing so. �Look, I know that there are huge risks involved in dropping everything to chase your dreams, but I�m more willing to go out on that ledge than most people, because I have faith in my dream and in the financial advisors who are ready to cushion my fall.� At press time, the rejection of her script by two studios had forced Rockwell to consider a return home in disgrace to New York, where she would put aside her dreams and help run her family�s multi-million-dollar investment firm."
"Responding to their grandfather�s longtime silence on the subject, the family of World War II veteran Thomas Withers told reporters Monday that they figured the reason he never talked about serving was probably because nothing interesting happened to him. �Grandpa never discusses being stationed in Normandy, and he always gets really quiet whenever the subject comes up, so he must have spent the whole time puttering around Europe and just kind of hanging out,� said granddaughter Elise Phippen, who attributed the sad, distant look that appeared in her maternal grandfather�s eye on the anniversary of D-Day to regrets that he didn�t have even a single cool story to share about being a G.I. �I looked up his platoon, and I know they saw a fair amount of action, but I guess Grandpa was just doing clerical work the whole time or maybe he was working as a cook or something, because he�s never so much as mentioned any of it.� Phippen went on to theorize that Withers� habit of bolting awake in the middle of the night was likely a side effect of the sheer boredom he experienced doing nothing but sitting in a room playing cards for four years."
"Exclaiming and pushing past each other as they jockeyed for a clear view of the screen, friends of local man Carl Michaels excitedly gathered around his phone Monday to watch the shaky footage he had recorded of a recent Mt. Joy concert. �Whoa, the audio is so distorted that you can barely even make out what song they�re playing�this fucking rocks,� said friend Brett Osnos of the blurry seven-second video, stressing how cool it was to hear a tinny, near-unlistenable stretch of the song�s bridge that was punctuated by a drunk woman screaming in the background. �That one part is killer where the light show gets so bright that the image turns completely pixelated and blown out. And it�s so sweet how you can barely see the band on the stage because most of the picture is taken up by a bunch of heads and people holding up their phones. Seriously, you�re a fucking god for scoring this.� At press time, numerous friends were frantically offering to pay Michaels upwards of $100 for the privilege of acquiring the �completely legendary footage� for their own phones."
"In a move relieving his firstborn of the mounting stress associated with the pursuit of his life�s ambition, ailing father Gideon Albright selflessly offered his son, aspiring writer Julian, 27, the perfect excuse to move back home and give up on his dreams. �My father�s diagnosis was tangible proof that when you really need to relinquish control�and therefore responsibility�over what you�re doing with your life, the universe will deliver. This is exactly what I needed to finally stop struggling with my novel,� said Albright, expressing feelings of deep relief that he would be giving up his apartment for at least a year, and perhaps as many as three if his father�s condition stretched out for a cruel and heartbreakingly long time. �Now, whenever friends ask me how life is in the big city, I can say that for now, I just need to be there for the old man. This is exactly what I needed to hear after driving myself crazy with anxiety and self-doubt.� Julian said his first act upon moving home would be to thank his father for the opportunity while he could still recognize how much it meant."
"Awed and profoundly moved after witnessing such Zen-like serenity and focus, sources close to pistachio-eater Lawrence Carmichael confirmed Wednesday that he had achieved a complete �flow� state while snacking on the shelled seeds. �I believe his consciousness tuned out all extraneous stimuli or phenomena until his entire universe became encompassed by that simple bowl of nuts,� said astonished onlooker Ryan Martinez, who claimed to have �glimpsed a brief yet somehow boundless flicker of eternity� in the mesmerizing rhythm of Carmichael�s opening of the culinary nuts, consumption of the delicious nutmeats, and discarding of the shells, during which his motions echoed the movements of the planets in their orbits and the very stars in their heavenly courses. �This is unbelievable. This is beautiful. It�s incredibly efficient and unfathomably elegant and somehow absolutely effortless, all at once. I�ve been watching him for 20 minutes now and he�s barely noticed.� The delicate equilibrium of Carmichael�s flow state was later disturbed beyond recovery after he choked to death on a shell."
"Calling its clearly laid out regulations �surprisingly refreshing,� conservative Floridian man Ernest Moyer told reporters Friday he enjoys living under Sharia Law much more than he thought he would. �I gotta admit, when I said �Those damn Arabs are gonna ruin democracy� I didn�t expect strictly abiding by the words of Muhammed would be so amazing for me,� said the 63-year-old follower of Islam, who, despite once fearing �the rule of that Muslim Obama and his Saudi P.C. militia,� now enjoys submitting his will to the Almighty during daily prayer, almsgiving, and his countless other fiqh rituals. �Sure, I miss drinking beer, but overall�thank Allah�I�m loving it. Praying towards Mecca is great, and eating Halal is pretty awesome if you know how to really prepare it. Plus, there�s these great retributive penal orders like stoning, beheading, and amputating�and I�m not just saying that because apostasy is punishable by death.� Moyer added that in a lot of ways, such as the law�s hostility towards women, gays, and criminals, things have barely even changed."
"Attributing her current apathy to being stuck in the wholesaler�s remote canned goods aisle, Costco employee Tanya Fairbanks quietly remarked Friday that �Once they put me on cheeses, I will finally be happy,� as she handed out free samples of Vienna sausage. �I used to think that if I could just get put on free sample duty all my problems would go away, but once I got sausages I realized that true success is running the cheese station,� said Fairbanks as she stood beside the mostly untouched tray of bite-sized pieces of Libby�s brand Vienna sausages, each set in an individual serving cup and skewered with a toothpick. �Aisle 26 right between housewares and dairy�that�s where the real action is. If I could just get my foot in there and work my way up to running the Hillshire Farm spread, I could finally relax and enjoy everything I�ve worked for. Having a line of smiling customers waiting for you to offer them a selection of aged goudas or extra sharp cheddars has got to feel like a million bucks.� At press time, a dejected Fairbanks confirmed that she was trying to make the best of her stagnating career by accepting a lateral promotion to passing out Nature Valley granola bars."
"Noting that he typically advises anyone under 120 over 80 to go apeshit, local internist Dr. Alan Thal told patient Matt Richards Friday that his blood pressure read fairly normal, so he should really fucking let it rip. �Well, Mr. Richards, you�re at 118 over 74. That means do whatever the hell you want. Get wasted, start a smoking habit�who gives a shit, just fucking go nuts,� said Thal, adding that he�d like to keep an eye on it, but in the meantime, Richards is going to want to eat as much delicious, salty food as he wants and cut loose. �Blood pressure is measured in terms of systolic and diastolic numbers and, since both of yours are fine, you can stop wasting time exercising and do some real crazy shit. Keep in mind, you�re 51 and not getting any younger, so I strongly suggest going balls-to-the-wall sooner than later.� At press time, Richards had died as a result of hypertension 20 minutes after leaving the doctor�s office."
"Touting it as an incredible opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a lucrative business endeavor, child venture capitalist Aidan Frost reportedly invested $2.50 Thursday in his friend�s new slug-eating enterprise. �I�m pleased to announce that I�ve agreed to make a more than two-dollar investment in Brian [Keller]�s innovative and promising plan to consume an entire huge, gross slug at recess,� said the 8-year-old angel investor, adding that he also planned to provide Keller with business advice related to the timing and marketing of the slug-eating launch, as well as put him in touch with his network of other jungle gym�based financiers in an effort to secure additional seed funding. �Slug-eating is poised to disrupt the playground, and while it�s definitely a lot of money up front, it�ll more than pay for itself with the amount of attention we should receive, especially if Brian pukes. It�s my hope that we can use Brian�s passion for eating gross stuff to expand this venture into worms or even pennies, or maybe start up an incubator where other entrepreneurs from across Mrs. Horgan�s class can develop ideas for other nasty things to eat.� At press time, the frustrated child venture capitalist acknowledged his failed investment after an investigation into the venture by playground supervisor Mr. Cunningham, who took away the slug and sent them both inside for the rest of recess."
"Expressing frustration after yet another company employee visited her office with an issue, human resources director Sally Kent told reporters Thursday that she doesn�t know what exactly it is about her that makes people want to unload all their problems. �I have absolutely no idea why they all want to lay their troubles down on my doorstep,� said Kent, explaining that ever since she started with the company over a year ago, her coworkers have been coming to her office with every boss-, coworker-, and salary-related conflict they have. �I listen to them, of course, but in the back of my head I�m thinking, �Why the hell are you telling me this?� Am I too nice? Do I have the kind of face that says �Tell me what your issue with payroll is?� Some of their problems sound really serious, and they should go to someone who can help them, not me.� At press time, Kent was unavailable to answer any further questions due to a new �Do Not Disturb� sign placed prominently on her office door."
"Finding themselves hopelessly out of their depth despite years of training in emergency field medicine, a local team of paramedics told reporters Wednesday that they had no idea how difficult it would be to cut a dangerously drunk woman out of an Elmo costume. �Good God, how did she even breathe in this thing? There was almost no ventilation even before the vomiting started, and this head alone must weigh 20 pounds,� said veteran EMT Alex Iglesias, marveling at the costume�s extremely constrictive polyester-resin design, which was then layered with a thick, red furry material of some unknown origin that seemed designed to dull medical shears. �Of course the fucking zipper got stuck, and the fabric is too thick to get a needle through. Not only that, but she also used several layers of duct tape around the interior of the neck to keep the head from falling off, so I don�t know how we�re supposed to intubate her. We may have to use the actual Jaws of Life to get her out of there if she doesn�t stop flailing and asking us if we know where her friends went.� Iglesias and his team also say they have �no earthly idea� how the woman managed to get the liquor bottles into the costume with her."
"Cramped and frustrated at being unable to interact with any of the other guests, Halloween party attendee Hayley Crawford divulged Wednesday that she was sick of being stuck as the back half of the Velma costume. �It�s unbelievably hot back here and I�m tired of suddenly being pulled around without warning whenever [Velma front half] Kelly [Armbruster] wants a drink or sees someone she knows. We�d better be switching out soon,� said Crawford, who claimed she and fellow Scooby-Doo fan Armbruster had spent hours making the elaborate costume only for most people at the party to not even realize she was there. �I have to undo this flap in her skirt every time I want to have a drink, which almost always spills, and now Velma�s right foot has pretty much filled up with beer. This sucks. Next year, I�m just going by myself as a camel.� Crawford eventually left the party early and went home with the middle third of Thomas the Tank Engine."
"Wringing his hands as beads of sweat began dripping down his forehead, local man Samuel Karpinski repeatedly sought to reassure himself Wednesday that the giant hot dog moving down the sidewalk toward him must be nothing more than a costume. �Stay calm, stay calm�it can�t hurt you,� a visibly shaken Karpinski said to himself as the 6-foot-tall polyester foam hot dog came closer and closer, showing no signs of returning to wherever it came from. �Just keep your eyes forward, don�t look at it. Gotta be just a guy in a costume, right? Remember what day it is. Oh, God, it�s covered in mustard and ketchup! Is it following me? Shit!� At press time, sources stated that Karpinski had sprinted away in fear only to turn the street corner and find a giant banana walking his way."
"Struggling to convey his exasperation through a set of plastic fangs, seasonally costumed reveler Aaron Greenstone admitted feelings of exhaustion and hopelessness Wednesday after explaining his Dracula Halloween costume for the �umpteenth� time. �I thought it would be super clever if I dressed up this way, but it turned out to be more trouble than it�s worth,� said Greenstone, 35, noting that he had already been mistaken for Batman, Harry Potter, and Goth Jared Kushner. �I eventually just started telling people that I�m a vampire, but they�re like, �Huh? What�s that?� When I hiss at them, they ask if I�m a cat. When I tell them I want to suck their blood, they�re just confused and weirded out. Somebody came up to me in the kitchen a few minutes ago and was like, �Hey, I get it! You�re a steampunk dentist!� I give up.� A dejected Greenstone was later seen leaving the party in the company of an individual who had evidently dressed as a large, green arthritic with bolts in his neck."
"Noting no improvements since suddenly appearing on his left arm several weeks ago, a detailed report released Tuesday by local man Derrick Hart revealed that his rash was not going away. �I don�t know what it�s from, but now it�s starting to hurt,� said Hart, explaining that he first noticed the skin irritation over three weeks ago and after conducting several methods of treatment, including soap and water, anti-itch cream, and, finally, leaving it alone for a few days, he concluded that these experiments had little to no effect. �It has definitely changed; there�s a weird, yellowish crust growing on it now. I�m pretty sure this is a sign it�s getting worse though because now it�s on my other arm, too.� Hart concluded that further research would need to be done as he entered his symptoms into an internet search browser."
"Surveying the unfamiliar terrain in which he found himself, bus passenger Aaron Coleman deduced by his surroundings Wednesday that he had either not yet reached his desired stop or passed his stop a long time ago. �I must�ve spaced out during this part of my trip, because none of this looks quite right. Either I have to wait it out for a little bit longer or I�m already way too far gone,� said Coleman, 31, who recognized some distant buildings through the window, but wasn�t sure if they were coming closer or moving farther away than was optimal. �Maybe if I hop off now, I�ll be close enough to walk. Then again, I�d feel pretty dumb if I�m only a few stops away from home.� At press time, Coleman had resolved to ride another 40 minutes until the bus reached its last stop."
"Describing the experience as �no fucking picnic,� an as-yet-unnamed newborn protruding halfway out of his mother�s vagina confirmed Thursday that the 14-hour labor experience had not exactly been a cakewalk for him, either. �Just so we�re clear, this sucks for me, too. I would love to get someone to wipe the mucus out of my eyes. Or maybe some ice chips?� said the 7-pound, 4-ounce infant, who felt his cries for assistance had gone completely unnoticed by the nearby team of doctors working to improve conditions for his mother while he was jammed inside a hot, cramped birth canal all goddamn day. �If anything, this whole labor thing is way worse for me, because at least she gets to be pumped full of drugs and she isn�t dangling face-first out of her mother�s cervix. Let�s just say, I can think of better ways to spend my day that don�t include having the shape of my head changed by someone�s reproductive tract. Unbelievable.� At press time, the baby had rolled its newly opened eyes in disbelief for the first time ever upon overhearing his father tell his basically unconscious mother that she was doing �an amazing job.�"
"Explaining that the severity of the situation called for desperate and perhaps even borderline extreme measures, recently dumped woman Ruth Beneke, 26, called her wildest friend up from the bench of associates and acquaintances Thursday in order to help her ease the pain from a recent breakup. �I have so many sensitive, supportive friends, but this breakup calls for someone a little, let�s say, intense. Karen [Rasmussen] has not been completely reliable, so she�s been on the bench for a few years, but I really need her unhinged, borderline dangerous sense of fun right now,� said Beneke of Rasmussen, who arrived with a stirring cry of �Let�s take you out!� and the insistence they �go somewhere and just fucking dance,� as well as several utterly believable threats of bodily harm toward the ex-boyfriend in question. �If I�m going to get over this breakup, a couple glasses of chardonnay with Sophia or Tami aren�t going to cut it�that�s where Karen comes in. She�s a great distraction, but even beyond that, she makes me feel a lot more together by comparison because so many of her exes are in jail. We may not be super close, but she�s absolutely crucial for situations like these.� At press time, Karen had ordered the pair another round of tequila shots from the Applebee�s bar.
"
"Explaining that seeking professional psychological help was a big scam when there were better, cheaper alternatives, local man Justin Treanor told reporters Monday that he doesn�t understand why people waste money on a therapist when they could just emotionally crush their girlfriend. �A therapist can cost hundreds of dollars for just one session, but taking your problems out on the one who loves you is free,� said Treanor, adding that his romantic partner was always there when he needed to work things out by destroying her spirit, while scheduling an appointment with a therapist was time-consuming and could take weeks. �Why wait a month and possibly have to take time off of work to see a counselor when my girl is already right there to belittle and blame at home? Besides, if I�m going to confront my demons, I�d rather have someone I know and trust to lash out at.� Treanor added that he knew it was the right decision when he experienced a recent breakthrough that resulted in his girlfriend crying herself to sleep."
"Emphasizing that communication was a �two-way street,� local man Thomas Ross expressed concern Monday that he was being heard, but not listened to by a representative taking his call on the Oscar Mayer customer service hotline. �I just keep talking and talking, and it�s like you�re not even listening at all,� said Ross, adding that it hurt him deeply to have his vulnerability met with such callous indifference by a customer service representative who he had assumed cared about him. �What about what I want, Reggie? Is it too much to ask for a three-cheese hotdog? All you do is offer platitudes and pretend like we haven�t had this conversation a dozen times before. You should at least have the balls to give it to me straight, Reggie! I think you owe me that much.� At press time, Ross accused the representative of exploiting a power imbalance in their relationship by bringing his manager into the fold."
"Saying that she could sense Satan within them the moment they walked through the door, Sunday school teacher Elizabeth Reath told reporters this weekend that she could already tell which of her students at First Baptist Church of Langhorne were going to Hell. �At this point in my career, I can tell just by looking at them which ones will be saved and which ones will be damned to burn in fire and brimstone for all eternity,� said Reath, emphasizing that within minutes of getting to know each of her 20 students, she had already isolated the 8-year-olds who had been marked by the Devil and had �placed her bets� on the ones that seemed destined to be banished to the Inferno later in life. �By the time they get to me, it�s way past the point where I can just pray for them and save them from their final judgment day. I mean, half the kids in this class have had at least one parent who will end up in Hell. At this point, they may as well just surrender themselves to Satan.� At press time, a visibly disappointed Reath had reprimanded one of her star pupils for interrupting class after being possessed by a demon."
"Noting the dramatic change in snacks and beverages made available at the Pisinski household, sleepover sources confirmed Friday that Logan�s mom had put him on a diet. �He�s not allowed to have any soda or candy, plus his mom put all the bags of chips way up high in the pantry so he can�t reach them,� said Jesse Weir, adding that while he and the other guests ate pepperoni pizza, Logan was served a green salad with a fat-free dressing and was offered the choice between a rice cake topped with cottage cheese or an apple for dessert. �He�s got a whole section in the refrigerator labeled �Logan�s Snacks� and there�s nothing good in there, just carrots and celery sticks. When Mrs. Pisinski caught Logan eating some M&Ms that Kevin brought, she made him spit them out in the trash, so it�s a pretty big deal.� Weir added that he probably wouldn�t be going back over to Logan�s house for a while after Mrs. Pisinski told them they couldn�t play video games and should instead all go outside to get some exercise."

"Without ever diverting his eyes from the tiny blinking window in the right margin of the website he initially came to 20 minutes ago, local man Jack Calderon told reporters Tuesday he�s doing really well at the slot machine demo embedded in the ad in the corner of his computer screen. �I�m just getting jackpot after jackpot. What is this, 17 times in a row? I have work to do, but I obviously can�t quit now,� said Calderon, adding that he was nervous about jinxing his hot streak. �After those first three sevens, I thought, �If I lose now, that�s fine,� because I gave it my all and I played well. But I�d be lying if I said I wasn�t stoked when I got three sevens for a second, third, and fourth time. Getting three bananas after that was just the cherry on top.� At press time, Calderon confirmed that he was �on such a roll� that he had decided to quit his job.�"
"Sharing the key factor that had the greatest impact on his durability, 104-year-old Wallace Skinner revealed Monday that the secret to long life was being cursed by a witch to eternally wander the Earth. �I do the crossword every morning, I have a glass of scotch with dinner every night, and in 1937, an enchantress damned me with wretched immortality,� said Skinner, who credited his longevity to a chance encounter 81 years ago when he scolded and pushed an old beggar woman out of his way, only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful sorceress and punish his cruelty by casting a spell that allows him to age as normal but never die. �I do try to eat healthy, but most food turns to ash the instant it crosses my lips. I also walk a lot, but that�s mostly to escape the ever-present torment of seeing generations of loved ones pass on to the next life while I�m trapped here in perpetuity.� The cursed centenarian added that he has no regrets, but that if he could do it all over again, he probably would have been nicer to that witch."
"Noting that there�s simply not room in his life for both a serious commitment and the numerous serialized dramas he�s currently watching, local man Rob Anaya told reporters he�s thankful to be single during the golden age of television. �Things have just been going so well recently with Man In The High Castle and Handmaid�s Tale, I would never want to put all that on hold for a girlfriend,� said Anaya, explaining that, with Netflix having just renewed gritty crime drama Ozark for a third season, this was the ideal time for him to be unattached. �God, can you imagine if I were on a date right now instead of spending another night watching Better Call Saul alone in my room? I mean, I just got an HBO Go subscription to rewatch all-time classic prestige dramas Six Feet Under and The Sopranos, not to mention that new episodes of High Maintenance, Game Of Thrones, and Insecure are just around the corner. I�m just so grateful I don�t have a devoted significant other jeopardizing that.� At press time, Anaya was discussing the latest episode of The Good Place with his coworkers, each of whom manages to watch the show every week with their spouse."
"Noting that the sick colleague had been instructed to �take it easy� and �hang in there,� local brand manager Cassandra Reynolds confirmed Thursday that all of the good sentiments on a coworker�s �get well soon� card were already taken. �Shit, somebody is already sending him good vibes, too,� said Reynolds, admitting she had no idea how to even address the man who had already been referred to as �buddy,� �big guy,� and �chief.� �I was going to do �can�t wait to have you back,� but now that just seems so unoriginal. Of course, some asshole had to put �feel better� right there at the top. Fuck, three people are already praying for him? I guess maybe I could write the same thing as someone else but much bigger.� At press time, the coworker reportedly took a turn for the worse after seeing that the tactless Reynolds had simply signed her first and last name on the card."
"Saying that the admission represented a momentous new step in their relationship, advertising salesman Vince Fergus, 26, confirmed Wednesday that his �kinky� girlfriend had expressed interest in experiencing sexual pleasure later tonight. �I mean, I guess I�m game for whatever, but I just never thought of Jessie as the type of girl who would be into that sort of thing. She�s always seemed so normal and straight-laced,� said Fergus, who confessed he�d never experimented with providing sexual pleasure for any of his previous girlfriends, but insisted he was �down to experiment� and would be willing to broaden his physical horizons with his current partner as long as it was done carefully and with respect. �Honestly? I don�t know where she even found out about this stuff. She must have read something about it online. Of course I trust her, but I�m a little nervous�one of my buddies said he tried this type of thing with his girlfriend once, and it was kind of freaky and gross. They broke up right after that.� Fergus was later overheard admitting that his stomach dropped when his girlfriend added she�d also be interested in experimenting with foreplay."
"Saying that the jovial drawing will forever signify their bond of goodwill, local father Gary Ericson confirmed Tuesday that a smiley face doodled on their Buffalo Wild Wings meal check commemorates the undeniable chemistry between their waiter and the Ericson family. �Ever since Jason introduced himself by name and asked if he could start us off with anything to drink, I knew we had a connection,� said Ericson, recalling their server�s warm greeting, enthusiastic recommendation of the passion fruit iced tea, and frequent visits to the table to inquire as to how everything was going so far, all demonstrating a deep personal commitment and the foundation for what shall surely be a lifelong friendship. �The way he reacted when, after he asked how we had enjoyed our food, and I claimed it was terrible�even though I�d already finished all my wings? You don�t get that sort of delighted laughter from anyone but a bosom friend. And now, this smiley face stands forever as symbol of and monument to that very friendship.� Ericson sealed the eternal bond between Jason and his clan by leaving a 10 percent tip."
"Noting that the pathetic 30-year-old may as well have been invisible to the men around her, sources confirmed Monday that loser woman Kathleen Owens has never inspired even a single bar fight. �Strangely, the sight of Kathleen failed to motivate even a single guy to pick up a pool cue and smash it over the head of another guy while competing for her attention,� said a source close to Owens, emphasizing confusion as to how any female could inspire such indifference among men, let alone instigate by her very presence exactly zero bar-wide brawls resulting in the bartender firing a shotgun into the ceiling as a warning to the dozens of desire-crazed men violently competing for her favor. �Not once have I seen two men sidle up to her at the bar at the same time, say �Seat taken?� in accidental unison, and trade insults that escalate into a shoving match until a third suitor approaches, smashes the heads of the first two together, and sits down triumphantly beside her. She�s just hopeless. What�s wrong with her?� At press time, Owens was seen sighing between drinks of her cocktail as a fight erupted among the bar�s male customers over whose turn it was to play darts."
"Beckoning the boy to come closer so �Nana can feel those washboard abs,� local grandmother Shirley Paulson was reportedly amazed Monday by how fuckable her grandson has gotten since she last saw him. �My, Jackson, you are really growing into quite the grade-A slice of man meat! Ooh, I just want to pinch your tight little ass cheeks,� said the 83-year-old, embracing the 18-year-old while remarking that pretty soon he will be �slaying poon like nobody�s business.� �Heavens! When did you get this gigantic bulge of yours? Oh, I bet all the little girls at school already want to bang the shit out of you�tell me, Jackson, do you have a fuck buddy yet? Goodness gracious. What I did for God to bless me with so many sexy little numbers as grandchildren? I must be the proudest, wettest grandma in the world.� Paulson added that the 18-year-old is just as fuckable as his dad was at that age."
"Throughout the runtime of the two-hour movie, local mother of three Barbara Rosenstock, 62, took several opportunities Friday to declare her hatred for the bad guy. �Oh, he�s just being so mean to his girlfriend! That�s terrible. It�s just awful how he treats her!� said Rosenstock, gasping and shaking her head as the antagonist struck another character with a closed fist. �You don�t hit! Why would he do that? It�s so unnecessary. He�s just being a jerk. You would never act like that, right? I hate people who behave that way. So mean.� At press time, the mom announced �Oh, I like her!� upon seeing the film�s female lead resolutely standing up to the bad guy."
"Saying there�s just no better way to get the fresh thoughts percolating, local woman Isabelle Garner, 28, told reporters Friday that she gets all her best ideas while showering with two totally ripped hunks. �Whenever I�m feeling a little blocked, I hop in the shower with a couple of stunningly gorgeous Adonises with rock-hard abs, and before I know it, all sorts of new ideas come flooding in,� said Garner, explaining that there must be something stimulating about standing under a jet spray of hot water or pressing up against a pair of muscular, toned bodies that helps put her in a more imaginative frame of mind. �I don�t know whether it�s the soothing pressure of four muscular hands tenderly caressing me or the calming steam emanating from their incredibly sexy physiques, but somehow, the whole experience really gets the juices flowing.� Garner added that going for a walk or taking a nap with two jacked dudes also does the trick."
"Calling the dish one of the tastiest she�s had in some time, 61-year-old mom Karyn Stockton continued to rave Thursday about the butternut squash ravioli she tried 13 years ago during a vacation to Boston. �Who would have thought to put squash into ravioli?� Stockton said of the pasta dish she consumed in 2005 at West End restaurant Riccardo Trattoria and has been bringing up intermittently while out at other restaurants and even during lulls in casual conversation. �I think it had some sage in the sauce. Or maybe it was tarragon? I swear, we should try to make it some time. Gosh, it was a great dinner. I wish you�d have been there.� At press time, Stockton revealed that she once bought a frozen version that looked similar at Sam�s Club, but that it just wasn�t the same."
"In a move that obliterated the final vestiges of his youthful innocence, toddler Charles Mankiewicz, 3, was told Tuesday that he could no longer touch his own genitals at the dinner table, robbing him forever of the simple joy of childhood. �Stop that,� said the child�s joyless parents, ensuring that the small boy would never again indulge in the unleavened pleasure of sticking his hand down his own pants without being overwhelmed by all-consuming shame and deep self-loathing. �You can�t just do that, Charlie.� Sources close to the family report the bright smile and sunny disposition that had once defined the 3-year-old, along with the simple bliss of holding his penis, has given way to a bland numbness as the spark of curiosity fades from his dulled eyes."
"Expressing concern that the octogenarian appears too feeble to get the job done, sources confirmed Monday that the apartment management company had apparently sent a senior citizen to fix the sink. �At first I thought he was a resident who had wandered away from his nursing home, but then he said he was here to fix the leak and asked me to carry his toolbox up the stairs for him,� said roommate Tyler Porter of the elderly maintenance man who let slip a quiet groan as he lowered his frail body to the floor to examine the dripping pipe underneath the kitchen sink. �He stopped moving for a really long time while he was beneath the sink, so I was kind of worried he died. I keep peeking in from the living room to make sure his chest is still rising and falling. Honestly, this dude looks like he might kick it any second.� At press time, Porter announced plans to fix the still-broken sink himself as he couldn�t manage to watch the old man struggle any more."
"Following in the hallowed and time-honored civic footsteps of their forefathers, Middlebury town council members continued the 242-year tradition of American democracy Monday with 4-1 vote in favor of rezoning a residential lot to accommodate a new Popeyes Chicken franchise. �I�m always happy to support local businesses, but this new Popeyes would dramatically increase traffic along Route 22, which is already backed up as it is,� said city councillor Ben Calvi, exercising his inalienable right to stand against the majority and, in the process, doing his part to write the next chapter in the story of American freedom. �That intersection already takes forever to get through, and it�s going to be way too busy now.� At press time, experts on constitutional law heaped praise on the newly opened Popeyes in a tradition whose roots reach back over 25 centuries to Solon of Athens."
"Unable to completely dismiss his doubt over his partner�s motives, a male North American black-billed magpie admitted Monday his concerns that his mate was only interested in him for the vast collection of shiny objects lining his nest. �I invited her over to the tree to chill, but she spent more time fondling my disco ball keychain than talking to me,� said the bird, who reluctantly answered his beloved�s increasingly detailed questions about how he amassed so many foil gum wrappers. �I�m more than just a single misplaced pendant earring�I have a lot to offer someone. I really want to be with her, but do I have to keep collecting more and more shiny things to keep her satisfied?� At press time, the magpie, who, like all corvids, is intelligent enough to perform rudimentary counting, was �fairly sure� his stash of glittery hair ties had been dwindling recently."
"Increasingly confused and embittered after noticing several eerie similarities over the course of their chit-chat, local woman Carrie Vance reportedly felt a twinge of betrayal Friday while sitting in the waiting room of her local salon and watching her hairdresser make small talk with another customer. �What the hell? I thought we had something special,� said Vance, looking on in horror as she overheard her hair stylist asking the other woman about her job and the weather just as the two of them had discussed at their first appointment three months earlier. �Now she�s asking her where she�s originally from? Wow, this sort of stings. We had such a nice conversation during my last haircut�I really thought she was opening up to me�and now it�s clear it was all an act. God, I feel like such an idiot.� At press time, Vance reported feeling �completely devastated� after her hairdresser began their follow-up appointment by repeating the exact same smalltalk as when they first met."
"Pointing to a more animated presentation style and a charisma that was evident from only a few overheard words, members of the Hidden Treasures Capitol tour confirmed Thursday that the guide one stop behind them was clearly giving a far more interesting tour. �As we were leaving the Rotunda, I could just make him out telling the group after ours some sort of fascinating-sounding story about George Washington laying the cornerstone of the capitol that our guy didn�t even mention,� said tour-goer Lisa Snow, adding that the guide behind them appeared to be cracking jokes and throwing in personal anecdotes to add some local color, in stark contrast to her own docent, whose lack of passion was evident from the way he mumbled through an explanation of architect Charles Bulfinch adding the dome in the 1850s. �I can�t believe I wasted $30 on this loser when I could have been lead around by a real talent if I�d just waited until the 2:30. I even contemplated holding back and trying to sneak into his group, but somebody probably would have noticed.� Snow added that at least she wasn�t with the tour guide one stop ahead, who had repeatedly forced her group to wait around as he wrapped up his long-winded spiel."
"In a practice designed to prepare him for the unpredictability of life in general, systems analyst Anthony Cochrane, 29, has consumed multiple servings of spaghetti, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, toast, doughnuts, snack crackers, and garlic bread so far this week, a nutrition regimen he pursues �just to be safe.� �I try and keep my kitchen constantly stocked with bagels, pasta, English muffins, cereal, corn muffins, rice, white bread, sourdough, French bread, and maybe a loaf of rye, because one really never knows when they�ll be expected to run a half-marathon or a charity 5K,� said Cochrane, using bean dip to adhere a second tortilla wrap to his routine midnight burrito, which provides a much-needed source of glycogen on impromptu sunrise hikes or long-distance 6 a.m. bicycle treks. �Sugars and starches might be unhealthy for sedentary types, but you don�t want to be stuck with low energy in a spur-of-the-moment 400-meter match race or rock climbing expedition. That�s why I always �top up� with yogurt, chips, and Clif bars between the four courses of my breakfasts, my sandwiches at lunch, and the chicken parm and pot pie at dinner.� At press time, Cochrane was observed vomiting up a high-carbohydrate melange of noodle casserole, french fries, and baked yams roughly 200 meters into a charity fun run."

"After he was unable to come up with a precise age for any of the dozens of people in his life, sources confirmed Monday that local man Edward Warriner has absolutely no clue how old anyone he knows is. �My dad�s probably in his late 50s, so that means my mom has to be somewhere around there, too, but I�m not totally sure,� said Warriner, adding that he was pretty confident that all of his friends were 28 or 29, just like him, but quickly admitted that he had nothing to base that on. �I think my niece is in middle school�or, come to think of it, maybe it�s high school�she�s definitely a teen or a pre-teen. Oh! My grandpa just had a birthday, and it was his 85th�no, 95th? That can�t be right.� Warriner added that he wasn�t sure how old any of his coworkers were either and, now that he thought about it, he realized that he didn�t know a single one of their names."
"Admitting that he certainly likes the son of God but �doesn�t exactly love the guy, per se,� self-described casual Christian Brian Neely disclosed Monday that he accepts Jesus Christ as his lord but not his savior. �Listen, I know Jesus is the King of Kings, but I�m pretty sure I can deliver my own soul from eternal peril and reconcile myself with God the Father just fine on my own,� said Neely, 35, who was raised Catholic and was taught to look into his own heart, but who �would never in a million years ask for help entering into the Kingdom of Heaven.� �Don�t get me wrong, Christ�s undying love and eternal wisdom guide me in my never-ending quest to lead an honest life, a life that reflects His values and teachings, but rescue us from the wages of all sin? I don�t care who your dad is, that�s a lot to ask from anyone.� Neely added that, while he finds God to be good, he is personally still on the fence as to whether He is, in fact, great."
"Noting that the season seemed to come earlier and earlier every year, local Bhutanese man Sangay Wangyel told reporters Friday that he couldn�t believe his neighborhood pharmacy was already stocking stuff for Lhabab Duchen. �It�s still more than a month away and they�re already laying out the wooden shrines and their little statues of Buddha?� said an annoyed Wangyel, wondering aloud why the cheap butter lamps and the paper plates bedecked with gyeling horns had to take up two full aisles of the store. �Jeez, Chokor Duchen has barely even passed, and they�re already trying to milk us for our hard-earned ngultrums. It�s ridiculous. Don�t get me wrong�I like Lhabab Duchen as much as the next guy, but can�t we have a little bit of a break before all these shops break out their winter solstice decorations for Nyinlong?� At press time, Wangyel had bypassed the holiday aisle, saying he planned to return after the celebrations were over and all the plastic triple ladders representing Buddha�s descent from the heavenly realm were half-off."
"Satisfied that she took great pains to ensure her son met every outward description of an upstanding citizen, mother Molly Fitzgerald told reporters Thursday she was proud to have raised the type of young man no one would ever believe capable of raping someone. �No one will ever worry about Tyler acting up at a frat party, harassing his coworkers, or misbehaving on a date because I�ve carefully raised him to meet society�s expectations of a man who simply doesn�t do those things,� said Fitzgerald, who always made sure her son affected a clean-cut appearance while pursuing a prestigious and lucrative career so that, furthermore, it would be assumed he would not ever need to coerce women into sex. �I always made sure he was polite and said �please� and �thank you,� because I know how important it is for other people to think of him as a nice guy and that any girl who might speak out against him is just making things up. I know, I know, sometimes Tyler thought I was being too hard on him growing up, but someday, maybe the morning after an office party or giving the babysitter a ride home, he�ll look back and appreciate that I raised him to get away with doing absolutely anything he wants.� Fitzgerald also expressed pride that her son sought out the friendship and company of other men who had been raised to treat women with respect in any situation where there are witnesses."
"Saying that he had reached a point in the relationship where he felt much more at ease, local man Greg Peterson, 32, told reporters Wednesday that he was finally comfortable enough around his girlfriend to cheat on her. �When we�d just started dating, I was always nervous about something going wrong, but recently we�ve gotten to this level where I feel totally at ease cheating on Megan,� said Peterson, claiming that it was a huge relief to have enough trust built up in their relationship that he could exploit it by repeatedly having one-night stands and random flings while on work trips. �Five years on, we�ve fallen into this great rhythm where she does her thing, I cheat on her, and everyone�s happy. Honestly, I feel kind of silly for ever worrying that this would be an issue.� Peterson added that he had always wanted to achieve this relaxed stage in a relationship, having seen it work so well with his parents."
"Engaged in heated discussion over the artistic license taken in the creation of the animated show, local toddlers Lucas Leora and Mimi Raymond fiercely debated Tuesday whether Dora�s Explorer Girls was canon or part of Dora The Explorer�s expanded universe. �Listen, I�ve watched all the episodes, and Kate, Emma, Naiya, and Alana never even appear in the original series, which leads me to believe that this is essentially just fan-fiction for some dumb little babies,� said Raymond, citing her large collection of Dora The Explorer activity books to argue that the characters would have to be living in an entirely different timeline for the story to make sense. �The existence of these characters completely destroys Backpack�s entire character arc. Did they just expect us to go along with this sudden three-year time jump? This is the exact same shit PBS pulled with Daniel Tiger�s Neighborhood. It�s just a shameless cash-grab.� At press time, the toddlers had reached an agreement that the upcoming live-action Dora The Explorer movie coming out next year was �probably gonna suck.�"
"Musing philosophically on the deeply pleasurable possibilities, local man and potential electronic voyeur Tanner Mitchell, 27, wondered Tuesday whether there existed some form of website featuring footage of live sexual acts that interested parties might view for the purposes of self-gratification. �It would be most pleasing indeed to view such a webpage, if one does in fact exist, as it would allow me to view two or perhaps more individuals caught in flagrante delicto by the unblinking eye of the lens while engaging in various carnal recreation,� said Mitchell, reasoning that the internet was a vast place catering to, among others, collectors of Pez dispensers, scribes dedicated exclusively to Golden Girls fan-fiction, automobile enthusiasts, and even more picayune and peculiar fancies, and thus there surely must be erotic outlets available to a man such as he. �Mayhap if one endeavors to Google the term �sex,� some example or other may come up, a central pornographic clearinghouse, stockist, or shall I say �hub,� if you will. Certainly, the world must hold other souls who, as I do, seek the fleshier pleasures.� After a remarkably brief and uncomplicated search did in fact reveal to him a website of the most frank and forthright sexual nature, Mitchell realized that it did not, in fact, delight him in the slightest."
"Murmuring to herself about how breathtakingly small you once were, your mother formally announced Tuesday her plans to get out some of your old baby stuff and quietly stare at it. �Sometimes, seemingly out of nowhere, I remember what a happy baby you were,� said your mom, confirming her intention to sit in your room, warmed somewhat by a ray of buttery light from the setting sun, sighing wistfully while gently caressing your old onesie with one papery, aging hand and gently shaking her head in disbelief at how quickly the time had passed. �Where did all those years go? One minute I�m nuzzling this tiny little warm creature, so small I have to hold its sweet-smelling head up, and the next you�re off God knows where in the world, all grown up. I�ll never get that time back.� At press time, your mother has reportedly been inquiring as to what she did wrong for that sweet little angel to turn out the way you did."
"Frantically beseeching her significant other to deal with the unpleasant intruder, Kathleen Fatica shouted down the hallway Monday for her boyfriend to come kill a humongous ax murderer she happened to stumble across in the bedroom. �Gary! Gary! Gary, come to the bedroom! Quick! There�s a creepy, gross, ax-wielding maniac in here!� said Fatica, who became upset after seeing the serial killer scurry towards the closet the instant she turned on the light. �Ew, is he looking at me? I think he�s looking at me, Gary�Bring a phone book or something to swat him! Oh, God, he�s so hairy!� At press time, Gary Simon, Fatica�s boyfriend, was treated for deep wounds and severe bleeding after he calmly collected the huge ax murderer and released him outside."
"Sprinting onto the field with a thundering roar of �Pardon us, please,� the scrupulously polite Grandview Knights high school football team ran around a hand-drawn break-away banner Friday rather than bursting through it, recognizing that it must have taken hours of hard work to make. �So much talent and creativity went into the lettering and the drawings�so naturally we just detoured around the lovely thing,� said quarterback Jackson Reyes, who meticulously avoided damaging the banner as he led 40 of his teammates in charging to the field for warm-ups, pausing in their competitive zeal only to compliment the �brilliant artists� of the pep squad on the poster�s �phenomenal composition and bold color scheme.� �The numbers of every player on the team are on this. Can you imagine if we tore it apart like so much confetti? Homecoming is around the corner, and they�ll have more than enough to do�I�d feel just awful if they had to make another gorgeous banner because we were reckless and ripped it.� In related news, the Knights politely declined to return to their locker room at halftime so as not to miss the pep band�s much-practiced rendition of �Seven Nation Army.�"
"Immediately dismissing the high school senior�s chances of acceptance after reviewing his record, Yale admissions officers reportedly decided Friday that an applicant who had actually faced punishment for committing sexual assault was clearly not Yale material. �We have a very high standard here at Yale, and it�s abundantly clear that any applicant who has received actual consequences for sexual misconduct is just not someone who will thrive here,� said Yale admissions officer Paul Shelton, adding that lowering the university�s standards to admit the applicant who had been suspended from school and had to perform mandatory community service for sexual abuse was unfair to other applicants who had committed sexual assault and evaded all punishment. �What we look for in an applicant is evidence that he�s able to successfully intimidate his victim into silence, convince everyone that his victim is lying, or use his connections and family influence to get the whole episode swept under the rug. This is an elite school whose distinguished alums include President Bill Clinton, President George H.W. Bush, and Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, and we cannot in good conscience accept an applicant such as this young man who perpetrates sexual abuse and is unable to weasel his way out of any and all repercussions.� Admissions officers added that while the university is highly selective, they were committed to ensuring that any student who had successfully avoided punishment for sexual assault in high school would receive every opportunity to do the same during his time at Yale."
"Baffled by the unusual pace of their classmate�s social involvement, residents at a Knox College dormitory observed Friday that fellow student Andrew Witte had a friend from home visiting way too soon. �Well, okay. We�ve only been here a couple weeks, and Drew already has a high school buddy crashing in his dorm room. That�s just weird,� said floormate Ryan Bellows, noting that Witte�s friend lived nowhere even remotely close to their school and would have had to endure a six-hour drive from Minneapolis just so he and Witte could sit in the common room and watch YouTube on a laptop. �Andrew�s barely even done unpacking. He still carries a map of campus around with him, so I don�t know how he�s even trying to show his friend around. I overheard them comparing the sizes of their dorm rooms, so his friend just started college, too, but then why isn�t he there right now? Even if they�re dating, it�s too soon for a visit.� Dormitory sources further confirmed that Witte also began receiving care packages from his family after a mere week away from home."
"His eyes rolling back as the blinding light emanating from the display filled the room, local man Reeves Halko, his ragged voice barely audible over the deafening sound of cards shuffling faster and faster, confirmed Friday that he never asked for the overwhelming sensory assault of its victory animation. �Jesus...I just wanted to play a nice game of cards...what�s happening to me?� said Halko, who had thick, dark streams of blood flowing from his nose and ears as the software�s rapidly blinking �You did it!� popup caused him to retch between pained pleas of, �Christ, make it stop; please, for the love of God, make it stop,� that were then instantly drowned out by ear-splitting explosions as a dazzling array of multi-colored fireworks suddenly burst across his monitor. �I�m clicking and clicking, why is nothing happening? Goddammit, how do I get out of this? Why did I ever add that nine of spades to the first column! Why, oh, why! Oh, God, I think I�m gonna throw up.� At press time, Halko was finally at peace after succumbing to internal hemorrhaging."
"Shaken to his core by the realization that he had independently shared every significant detail of his fellow classmate�s vacation, fourth-grader Bryan Gardener was sent into a profound panic Thursday as it dawned on him that student Jimmy Perez, who gave his presentation immediately before Gardener, evidently experienced the exact same summer he had. �There�s no way I can go after this,� said Gardener, 10, sinking deeper into his chair with every description of Perez�s fun time at the beach, adventures with friends, and seeing the new Avengers film on two separate occasions. �Jimmy had a great time, too? I thought I did, but now it�s totally going to seem like I�m copying him. My report even starts with �What I Did Last Summer,� just like his. How was I supposed to know?� Bethany Cookmane, Gardener�s teacher, was unavailable for comment, having succumbed to depression brought on by the realization that she�d had the same summer as Perez."
"Failing to complete the simple task despite his ostensibly robust academic background, onlooking students at Kalamazoo College reported Wednesday that their supposedly educated literature professor Gene Cabella demonstrated no clue as to how to rid their lecture hall of a bird that had flown in through an open window. �He was talking a pretty big game about his intensive syllabus, then the bird came in and he completely panicked. Guess you didn�t get your PhD in birds, huh, Professor?� said sophomore Ken Pei, chuckling to himself as he sat back and watched his so-called academic superior frantically wave a manilla folder in the general direction of the bird, jump backwards when it flapped its wings in his direction, then spend the next few minutes attempting to ignore the creature�s loud chirps as if the entire class hadn�t just watched him desperately try to scare it away. �You�re the one in charge here, bucko. Sorry they didn�t teach you this at Yale�do they not have birds there? Well, guess what, you�re at Kalamazoo now, fucker, so you�re gonna have to learn to deal.� At press time, Professor Cabella�s credibility had reportedly taken an �absolute nosedive� after he paused the lecture once more to place a panicky, stuttering phone call to the campus maintenance department asking for assistance.�"
"After learning that the object of his desire was interested in other females, local man Dave Callan told reporters Wednesday that he had puzzled over whether she�s the type of lesbian who only dates other women or the kind that dates men, too. �Amy�s a lesbian�I know�but we really vibed the other night, so maybe she�s one of those lesbians who�s also kind of into dudes,� said Callan, adding that, since lesbianism existed on a spectrum, there�s a good chance that she�s attracted to at least some guys. �It really felt like we were about to kiss at the bar and then she told me she�s a lesbian, but there are so many different kinds of lesbianism. So does that mean no? It honestly doesn�t matter to me whether she�s a lesbian or not, I just want to know if I have a shot.� At press time, a rejected Callan was wondering whether Amy was the type who�s always a lesbian or the type that�s just trying it out."
"Wistfully imagining a future she hopes is not too far away, area woman Margaret Bridgemeyer told reporters Tuesday she yearns for the day when the first female president of the United States will have a tell-all book written about her that contains explicit descriptions of her repulsive vagina. �I have to believe in my heart that one day, there will be a woman in the Oval Office and that someone will publish a salacious account of how she has a nasty, thick bush or a really droopy labia,� said Bridgemeyer, adding that she wishes when she was young, she could have looked up to a woman who not only served her nation as commander in chief, but also had bombshell secrets about her genitals revealed to an American public eager to read about and discuss the subject. �I mean, just imagine if there were a woman in the most powerful position in the world�making key policy decisions, calling all the shots�and we were able to learn all the horrible details about her abnormally shaped clitoris, or maybe the weird consistency of her vaginal discharge. I know it may not happen in my lifetime, but just thinking about how my children or grandchildren might get to live in a country like that brings a tear to my eye.� Bridgemeyer went on to state that perhaps one day, there will even be a female president whose frequent extramarital affairs are common knowledge among her Evangelical Christian base."
"Carefully establishing a reminder lest they lose themselves in a moment of exuberance, fraternity brothers at the University of Virgina�s Sigma Chi chapter made a note Tuesday not to kill a member of their new pledge class during the intense hazing process, as his family happens to own a commodious and secluded lake house. �We have to make sure to go a bit easy on Phillip since his family has that boss lodge in Alexandria,� said fraternity brother Jeffrey Robinson, advising his brothers that the freshman should only perform half the butt-chugging required of standard candidates so that his safety is not put at unusual risk, thereby ensuring their chances at spending time at his family�s lakeside chateau with its attendant pontoon boat and all-season outdoor Jacuzzi. �I heard they have Jet Skis and, like, a big-ass movie theater room, so we should only make him drink 12 beers or so. And if he falls out of a fourth-story window, we have to call an ambulance right away. I know, I know, everyone wants to see him crawling on the ground and choking on his own vomit, but just this once we can wait until after spring break so he can invite us to chill at his parents� sick holiday home.� At press time, the fraternity brothers found themselves terrified at the possibility that their chances of an awesome vacation were ruined when the 18-year-old pledge became unresponsive after being beaten in the chest and abdomen with an orange-filled sock."
"In a singular and anomalous break in his lifelong absence from the wandering thoughts of humanity at large, systems analyst Steven Laposata, 34, was momentarily fantasized about for a period of roughly 15 seconds late Monday. Daydream sources confirmed that Laposata’s coworker and remote acquaintance Alexandra Katos idly and momentarily entertained the idea of personal intimacy with Laposata, experiencing a brief and disjointed flurry of thoughts that will forever serve as the sole incidence in Laposata’s eventual 82 years of life during which anyone has or shall consider him as an object of desire. Moreover, the 15-second period, of which Laposata is and will always be utterly unaware, quickly faded into a sequence of ruminations during which Katos thought of a series of much more romantically and erotically appealing individuals. At press time, Laposata was currently serving as an object of disgust for another three to five people and a cipher-like figure of indifference to dozens more."
"Emphasizing that “a lousy homemade coupon for free hugs dashed off at the last minute won’t cut it any longer,” mother of three Andrea Wolner told reporters Friday that her children were now officially old enough to pony up for a meaningful birthday gift. “Andrew, Gabe, and Jessica have jobs at this point, so a candle or a clay pot with tempera paint still drying on it is not going to fly,” Wolner informed her 16- and 18-year-old sons and 20-year-old daughter, who she fully expects to “lay out some actual cash” and not just promise to clean out the garage, prepare dinner, or do dishes for a week, responsibilities already within their regular purview. “A gift certificate works, but I’m not getting my goddamn nails done. Make it something I can put towards a spa day at that place I like on Rittenhouse Square or, so help me God, I’m going to lose it. And none of this pathetic ‘what-do-you-want-for-your-birthday-Mom’ crap. You live with me. Figure it the hell out.” As of press time, Wolner has yet to acknowledge receiving a handpicked assortment of local flowers and a vase obviously made in a high school ceramics class."
"Noting his decades of teaching experience and keen eye for talent, East Dubuque High School drama teacher David Vargo already has a pretty good idea who he’ll pick to be this fall’s girlfriend. “There were so many strong contenders this year, so it took me a while to narrow it down, but at the end of the day, Chloe [Quindlen] was just a head and shoulders above the rest,” said Vargo of the East Dubuque High School sophomore who first came to his attention as a chorus member in last winter’s production of Parade. “After Tina graduated last spring, I wasn’t really sure who was going to fill her shoes. It was extremely competitive, and you want to give every girl a good look and a fair shot, but I really think Chloe will come into her own in this role. Trust me, I’ll give her all the help she wants to blossom and grow.” Vargo emphasized that the role of his fall girlfriend was a prestigious one among East Dubuque’s female students, coming as it does with a near-guaranteed part in his spring fling as well as a chance to audition as his summer fuckbuddy."
"Calling the ordeal both “hilarious” and “classic Trevor,” representatives from Florida State’s Sigma Chi fraternity confirmed Friday that its brothers had drawn all over a pledge who passed away at a party. “Dude, Trev totally deserved to get fucked with because he passed away, like, super early last night,” said Sigma Chi rush chair Andy Martin, adding that the deceased freshman, Trevor McPike, 18, was being a “major pussy” and could not have drunk more than one bottle of Southern Comfort before succumbing to alcohol poisoning. “Seriously, he just kicked the fucking bucket like a total chump. That’s when we grabbed the Sharpies and went to town. Those are permanent markers, too, so there’s no way the coroner is going to be able to get it off. Oh, man, he’s gonna have a big ol’ dong on his head for the funeral. That shit’s epic!” At press time, Martin announced that the fraternity would honor McPike at a memorial service next week that also promised to be a “five-alarm rager.”"
"Having attempted numerous variations of color combinations and application techniques over the last two decades with only poor results to show for the effort, local woman Jessica Greenwald told reporters Thursday that she’s starting to worry that she just has the type of face where makeup looks completely insane. “The second I put on eyeshadow or lipstick, I look like someone who just escaped from a mental institution,” said 32-year-old Greenwald, noting that whatever she tries—a natural look or even a subtle cat-eye—the makeup in combination with her physical attributes instantly transforms her appearance into that of a deranged, nightmarish mutant. “I look completely normal without makeup, but as soon as I try something as simple as a sultry, smokey eye—Bam! I’m an unhinged, sleep-deprived, Jack-Nicholson-from-The-Shining-looking lunatic. Maybe it has something to do with my bone structure or my skin type that turns me into a creepy serial killer every time I try to contour or fill in my eyebrows, I don’t know.” Greenwald added that her makeup problem was exacerbated when she tries to do something nice with her hair and only ends up looking like a psychotic clown or a batshit crazy comic book villain."
"His eyes rolling in his head and his mane tossing as he contemplated the approach of the hulking figure in line at his paddock, Camp Hamilton resident Shetland pony Murph experienced an equine anxiety attack Thursday while waiting for his trainer to flag an unusually large child as being too big for a ride. “Oh, God, please no—this big boy is gonna break me in half,” said 4-year pony-ride veteran Murph, stamping and straining at his tether as he watched the alleged fifth-grader struggle to wedge his bulbous head into Camp Hamilton’s largest helmet, an adult XL. “What the hell are my handlers thinking? I mean, this kid is an absolute unit. Maybe he just wants to pet me? You put this chunka-chunk on a regular horse, he’d fuck him up into an upper-case V. Wait—is he eating a sub? A meatball sub? Jesus Christ, I’m going to die.” At press time, Camp Hamilton officials reported they are currently no closer to finding Murph, who broke free of his lead and galloped to the treeline upon witnessing the massive camper’s older brother elbowing to the front of the line."
"Officially transferring authority for the duration of his planned absence, area man Will Lewis deputized his friend to order him another beer while he went to the restroom, sources confirmed Wednesday. “Hey, grab me another drink if the bartender comes back around,” said Lewis during a brief ceremony in which he pointed to his near-empty pint glass and formally vested in his buddy Drew Arbery the powers needed to both select another brew for him and place it upon his tab. “I could go for a wheat beer or maybe a pilsner. Really, anything’s fine, as long as it’s not too hoppy. Thanks, man!” At press time, Arbery had reportedly been dishonorably discharged from his position for having neglected his duty by ordering an 11-percent-alcohol triple IPA."
"While discussing the long-sought secrets of luminous, blemish-free skin, dermatologist Dr. Risa Helene strongly recommended Wednesday that patients commit to a routine of not caring so much what other people think. “The best treatment out there—far healthier than vitamin-rich creams or clinically tested serums—is simply a sustained attitude of self-worth,” said Helene, adding that moisturizing was completely unnecessary if you just put yourself out there and let people see the real you. “Take it from me, most skincare issues, from enlarged pores and blackheads to rosacea and eczema, are caused by worrying too much about the opinions of those who shouldn’t even matter. A positive outlook and some confidence is really all you need for glowing skin. I used to recommend that patients remove any perfumes or scented lotions from their routine to eliminate rashes and dermal irritations, but you know what’s really irritating? Judgy people. As a doctor, all I can really tell you is that you’re beautiful when you just believe in yourself and don’t let negative talk bring you down.” Helene added that sunscreen was superfluous if you take time to look in the mirror twice daily and tell yourself you’re beautiful."
"Attempting to shake her thoughts regarding the horrific possibilities of the textile manufacturing industry, sweatshop worker Shanta Banek told reporters Wednesday that she doesn’t even want to know the working conditions of the facility where her company sources the fabric for their garments. “I often say to myself that factories can’t get worse than the hot, dark, poorly wired firetrap where I spend 16 hours every day, but that textile mill has to be worse, right? This incredibly cheap fabric just shows up and we don’t even consider where it came from, but now that I think about it—yikes,” said Banek of the 300 yards of cotton fabric piled near her sewing machine, a bolt of which she estimated could not cost more than 50 cents including shipping costs. “We get paid around 80 taka [U.S. 95 cents] a day to make shirts that will sell for $30 at the Gap, so the wages at the textile mill must be...my God, I can’t even imagine. That’s it—I’m applying for one of those sweet jobs at the aluminum foundry.” At press time, Banek had spiraled into a deep depression after briefly considering the potential conditions of the cotton growers who supplied the raw fibers to the textile mill."
"Fearing their friends and family members might not understand or accept the unconventional origin of their relationship, Margot Bradley and Josh Ezdon confessed their apprehension over divulging that they had met online in the comments section of a YouTube video titled “Ironing Your Shirts - STEP BY STEP.” “My parents are a bit old-fashioned, so this would be difficult to tell them, even though more and more people are finding love in online comments sections every day,” said Bradley, explaining that she and Ezdon had been brought together following a brief exchange of comments praising the clarity and efficacy of the video’s ironing technique. “As easy as the internet has made it for like-minded people to meet in interest-specific online communities, it’s become much more difficult to explain the exact circumstances of those meetings. I mean, one of my best friends met her husband in the comments section of “Bruce Springsteen - Jungleland (LYRICS),” and that type of granular instant connection just doesn’t happen in real life.” Bradley also reluctantly admitted that she and Ezdon had still not met up in person."
"Reluctantly acknowledging that he would soon need to go out of his way to strike up conversations with the seventh-grader, Stoller Middle School janitor Charles DeWalt had already deduced Tuesday that he was going to have to befriend transfer student Jackson Clancy. “This is the third day in a row he’s sitting all alone at the lunch table, so you just know I’ll eventually be forced to forge a friendship with him,” said DeWalt of the 12-year-old outcast who has been spotted reading in a bathroom stall and hanging out on the school grounds by himself after dismissal. “I could really use a semester to myself, especially with what I had to go through to get [previous sad sack] Mitch Lawrence to graduate. Why can’t the lunch lady take a turn befriending the big nerds?” At press time, DeWalt approached the student, leaned on his mop, and said, “You’re looking pretty glum, son.”"
"Standing firm in his commitment to the historic property amid mounting apprehension over the approach of Category 4 Hurricane Florence, Myrtle Beach resident Dennis Brock told reporters Monday he refused to evacuate from his family’s ancestral Ron Jon Surf Shop. “I don’t care what the government tries to tell me. This place is in my blood, and I’m not leaving no matter what,” said Brock of the beach apparel and souvenir shop where he and two of his cousins are currently employed as cashiers, where his uncle once worked as an assistant manager, and where his father once helped vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro pick out a pair of sunglasses. “I’m not some coward who’s just going to flee and abandon everything my family has worked so hard for. These flip-flop bottle opener keychains, these waterproof wallets, these boogie boards—they’re a part of who I am, and I’ll never abandon them. If I have to die, let me die in the place that I love, surrounded by collectable shot glasses and fridge magnets, wearing the Bob Marley T-shirt and board shorts of my people.” Brock reportedly prepared for the storm by stuffing several foam beer koozies and tie-dyed beach towels in the cracks beneath the store’s front doorway."
"Completely floored by his new appearance, sources at Pioneer Valley High School confirmed Monday that, whoa, their classmate Jeremy Lucas got totally hideous over the summer vacation. “Holy shit, Jeremy got super vile over the summer,” said Kimberly Stockton, 16, adding that she never really noticed Lucas before he became all gangly and grew body hair in all the wrong places, but now she could hardly stand to look away from his acne-covered face and greasy hair. “He’s really been turning heads with his noxious body odor, constantly cracking voice, and massive Adam’s apple. It’s hard to believe this guy with all of the wrong facial and bodily proportions is the same Jeremy we’ve known this whole time.” Stockton later added that she just knew everyone would clamor to be the first one to ask Lucas out as a joke. "
"Amazed by the archeological treasure trove he described as “hiding in plain sight,” museumgoer Nolan Terrell stumbled across a huge cache of rare fossils Friday while walking through the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. “My first thought was that this is a gold mine—there’s a massive diversity of fossils, everything from the Jurassic to the Cenozoic era, and they’re all in pristine condition,” said Terrell, marveling at the vast array of prehistoric remnants that, experts at the museum confirmed, could potentially alter the way people view the timeline of life on earth. “There appear to be a few barriers to collecting them, but as these seem to consist primarily of red velvet rope and glass, I’m sure it’s nothing fossil experts can’t handle.” Terrell said he will personally finance a paleontological expedition with the fortune he recently made after discovering a trove of natural gemstones and crafted jewelry on the museum’s second floor."
"Proving herself to be high maintenance and untrustworthy, two-faced house guest Anna Smithayer, who reportedly insisted that she didn’t need anything Wednesday, suddenly wanted a glass of water. “Who the fuck goes back on their word like that? One minute she’s like, ‘Oh, I’m all set,’ and the next she’s expecting me to wait on her hand and foot,” said homeowner Megan Lowry, hurriedly pouring a glass of water for the double-dealing traitor “before she changes her mind again.” “To see someone just do a complete 180 about their comfort level, it really makes you wonder—what else don’t I know about you? Can I trust that you won’t stab me in the back once again?” At press time, the notorious double-crosser had asked to use some of Lowry’s toothpaste merely hours after claiming she brought her own toiletries."
"Reveling at the opportunity to respond to an online post with the quintessential short, silent video loop, local fucking idiot Greg Knott told reporters Thursday that he has the perfect GIF for that. “Oh, man, this is totally spot-on,” announced the knuckle-dragging dumbass whose very existence is a testament to the depths of human stupidity. Several reports indicated that the utter dipshit struggled not to drool on himself while scrolling through his archives of .gif files of Jonah Hill, Donald Glover, Larry David, Judge Judy, Kayode Ewumi, Donald Trump, Chuck Norris, Robert Redford, and others saved on his computer desktop before deeming the three-second looped reaction shot of Will Ferrell in Anchorman as the ideal contribution to the conversation. At press time, the slobbering moron reportedly muttered, “hell yeah, that’s a good one,” and basked in the fruits of his internet curating efforts, seemingly oblivious to the fact that 78 other total fucking halfwits had the exact same stupid-ass idea."
"Disappointed at the outcome of the event she’d been eagerly awaiting for weeks, local woman Hannah Kaperski told reporters Thursday that she would have had an awesome time terminating her unwanted pregnancy if it weren’t for the angry protestors screaming outside the clinic. “It’s just such a bummer—you build up these amazing expectations for aborting your fetus only for a bunch of loud, obnoxious strangers to ruin everything,” said Kaperski, explaining that she’d made the appointment as part of a relaxing “me day” after weeks of feeling stressed out and overwhelmed by the prospect of putting aside her current personal and career goals in order to raise an unplanned child by herself. “This was supposed to just be a fun self-care day. I was so pumped to brag to all my girlfriends about it, but now I’ll have to include the part of the day where a middle-aged woman spat in my face and called me a murderer. It’s such a buzzkill.” Kaperski also admitted that, once she got past the throng of protesters, she did end up having a pretty fun time inside the clinic."
"Upon learning lifestyle company Goop had settled a lawsuit over false claims it made about the health benefits of its jade egg product, disillusioned local woman Melissa Salani reportedly began to question Wednesday whether any of her magical vagina stones actually possessed healing powers. “If my jade egg doesn’t really increase orgasms or regulate my hormones, how can I be sure all the other crystals and minerals I’ve been putting up there work?” said the visibly crestfallen Salani, shaking her head as she examined the $66 stone egg that she charges under the power of a full moon and, when it is not inserted into her vaginal canal, keeps wrapped in silk upon an altar. “I’m truly at a loss, because I felt so warm and energized when I had that rose quartz yoni egg inside me, just like the guru from the Goop website said I would, but now I can’t help but wonder if it wasn’t just a placebo. I’ve spent thousands on vaginal rejuvenation devices, and now I can’t even be certain they imbue me with vibrating energies while aligning my chakras and connecting me to ancestral spirits.” At press time, sources confirmed Salani was jamming handfuls of colorful stones up her vagina to counteract the feelings of negativity and self-doubt that were clouding her judgment."
